i also attended a masters/phd graduation ceremony at a major state university a few years ago - none of the cs degrees were awarded to blacks. [ a couple computer degrees went to blacks , but they were in it with a focus on internet marketing/web-commerce ] so where are all these black computer geniuses hiding?
