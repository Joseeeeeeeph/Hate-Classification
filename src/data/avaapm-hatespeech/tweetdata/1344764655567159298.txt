As my last tweet in 2020, I would like to share this. In Yerevan on New Year’s Eve, symbolic sky lanterns are released in memory of all the Armenian soldiers &amp; civilians killed in the Artsakh war. We will never forget all those who lost their lives. 🙏🇦🇲🤍#ArtsakhIsArmenia https://t.co/iUKh36FfdD
