Join us on Easter Sunday for our Dawn Service at 6:15am as we celebrate Christ, risen from the dead. A simple service of readings and prayers will take place outside the church, socially distanced around a fire, so wrap up warm.  Please bring your own coffee and hot cross buns! https://t.co/zRsWWHBMlz
