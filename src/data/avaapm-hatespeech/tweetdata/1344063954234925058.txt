Deeply saddened and shocked. The legendary Syrian Actor and Film Director Hatem Ali died today after suffering a heart attack.
Earlier in 2020, he joined our family and took on the main role in our movie that tells our story.
You will remain in my heart and the hearts of many. https://t.co/tHjiG73OOP
