My Instagram #BestNine for 2020. A year advocating for gun safety and involved in #LGBTQ activism. A year as an educator and a parent with my oldest completing his senior year of high school virtually along with millions of others. #gunsense #keepgoing @momsdemand #notgoingout https://t.co/ogJfXf7qZZ
