YOUTH | Fantastic day in our Junior League, closed with a groundbreaking initiative by @MaryPacitti &amp; @HemelAces fielding mixed gender squads for a friendly fixture. Well done to all boys &amp; girls, not only working together, but challenging each other in a positive environment! 👏🏼 https://t.co/RIn9DlPY5z
