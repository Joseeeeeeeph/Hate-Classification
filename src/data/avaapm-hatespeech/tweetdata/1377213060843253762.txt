Jesus knew that He was going to die a horrifying death on the cross but He was totally committed to the will of His Father. Godâ€™s will was that His Son would die as the penalty for our sins so that we could be forgiven. What an act of love and grace! https://t.co/7KjZ4SS44Z https://t.co/8FLwxMySFi
