College football is a sport played by predominantly Black athletes making billions of dollars for predominantly white institutions.

If your school says "Black Lives Matter" in an email but risks the health &amp; safety of young ppl bc football makes so much $ they are full of shit. https://t.co/1twDhMH32G
