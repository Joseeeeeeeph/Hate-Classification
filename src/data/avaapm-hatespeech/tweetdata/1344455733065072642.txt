Bangladesh has moved 3,000+ Rohingya refugees to an island camp prone to floods and cyclones. Rights groups say their homes were locked to force them to leave, and others were beaten.

The govt plans to move 100,000 refugees there. One said: "We just pray floods don't kill us." https://t.co/v1nheI8Mkl
