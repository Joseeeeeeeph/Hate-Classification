This year, at least 11 trans/gender non-conforming people were fatally shot or killed by other violent means, the majority are Black &amp; LatinX. The #JCClinic recognizes &amp; respects the trans/GNC community &amp; works toward equity for this community always. #TransDayOfVisibility. https://t.co/3i2iTZHgYl
