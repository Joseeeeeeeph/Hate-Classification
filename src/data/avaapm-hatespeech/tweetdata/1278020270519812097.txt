Some members of the @NHHouseofReps can’t follow simple directions. We can either press A or E; they’re even marked as to be (one hopes) idiot-proof. Not so. We had to vote on #HB1234 2x because some people voted C.  The @nhhouseclerk had to tell them again to vote either A or E. https://t.co/4ssfNi7C9y
