I AM SO TIRED ABOUT HEARING "WELL HE HAD DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM THAT'S WHY HE DIED NOT BECAUSE A 200LB MAN SAT ON HIS NECK.." 

A true Christian wouldn't care if there were drugs in his system.. I thought Christianity was about loving everyone no matter what.

 Don't be a hypocrite. https://t.co/8fHnvfFiiW
