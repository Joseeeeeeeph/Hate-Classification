My father fled Vilnius antisemitism, drew this in Lille, 1936: "Vilna police keep the peace ... From the newspapers: Vilna police, in the last police action during the last pogrom against Vilna Jews, took the side of the hooligans, to help attack the Jews." Today is his birthday. https://t.co/el6kwYLqFh
