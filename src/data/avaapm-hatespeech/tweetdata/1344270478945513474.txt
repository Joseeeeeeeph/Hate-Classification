Tsarevitch Alexey was days past his 11th birthday when his father went to the front to take command of the Russian army, leaving him as "the man of the house" in the capital. These pictures are from around that time, three years before the Bolsheviks murdered him and his family. https://t.co/nUqJqhlmu2
