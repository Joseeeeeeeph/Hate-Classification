Bittersweet today! Planned and organised the first Kayaking trip for my OE class. Injured my ankle at football and am unable to go. I hope they have a great 3 days and learn a lot about themselves and kayaking. Very appreciative of all the staff that stepped up to take my place! https://t.co/a6w9N2ChAK
