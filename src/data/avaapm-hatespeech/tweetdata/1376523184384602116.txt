In 1971, India took in Bangladeshi refugees &amp; even went to war to fight for their rights &amp; freedoms.

Today, the @BJP4India Govt. refuses to feed refugees &amp; is expelling them.

Didnâ€™t PM @narendramodi say he went on a satyagraha for refugees in 1971? Will he do so again? https://t.co/hHugHlzbuv
