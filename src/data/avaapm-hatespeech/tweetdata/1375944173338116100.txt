Wish I could have used this ingame: Sister Jean told me about playing basketball in HS (1930s)the court for girls divided in 3! She has sports in her blood, always tried to get kids involved. Such vitality &amp; joy as she spoke about @RamblersMBB So glad I finally got to talk w/her. https://t.co/l2Rnalc7Rs
