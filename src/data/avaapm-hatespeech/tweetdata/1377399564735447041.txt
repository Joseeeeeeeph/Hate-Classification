We remember #PeterMiles, who upstaged everybody in #QuoVadis (even stealing a close-up in the final scene) and went on to become a successful gay #Hollywood #scriptwriter. Born 1 April 1938. Died 3 Aug 2002. Do watch this tribute with #MiklosRozsa score: https://t.co/UCuzd1m3He https://t.co/72ehFOHkjI
