2 Capitol police are suing ex-President Trump for inciting the Capitol mob attack.

130+ officers were wounded and 1 killed. 2 others have died by suicide since.

Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” before the riot and told the mob “We love you,” but denies responsibility. https://t.co/SnmEdddnaR
