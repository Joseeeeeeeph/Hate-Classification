Just Another Anti-#Hindu Day in #Pakistan:

Hundreds of #Muslims attacked and set fire to a Hindu temple in #Karak district, some 100km from #Peshawar, the capital of #KhyberPakthunkhwa. 

Men were seen using hammers to damage the temple after an address from a local #Mosque. https://t.co/vwDgQC8s3x
