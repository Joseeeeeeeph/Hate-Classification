I’m guessing any student @DukeDivinity who openly celebrated MLK assassination &amp; urged he be dug up &amp; shot again would be discontinued, &amp; rightly so.  Should celebrating other assassinations, even if “joking,” be acceptable for seminarians preparing for service to God &amp; church? https://t.co/M2Jnpw90Ue
