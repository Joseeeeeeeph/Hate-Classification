Fun weekend in La Grange for Noahâ€™s high school baseball team tourney. So great to have Nate called up to be an assistant coach for the weekend for the high school team. Had a nice surprise to see my brother drive into town to come see us and to watch his nephew play some ball. https://t.co/GNRdEOk6iv
