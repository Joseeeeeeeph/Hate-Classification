Woman “can I give you something?”
Me: “sure!”
She hands me this, “we’ve all had someone pass...”
I nod, “YES! My cat just died!”
Blank stare by her
Me shrug, “hey we all got something. That and I’m gay” big smile. 
Continued blank stare

Me “ok then you have a wonderful weekend.” https://t.co/jHlPbE1A8S
