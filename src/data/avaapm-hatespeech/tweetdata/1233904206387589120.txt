I took some time to photograph an altered book project I did in 2017- I normally hate messing up books, 😅 but this one was an outdated non-fiction written in German, so I didn’t feel too bad. I put the full post up on Facebook, also on my Instagram story if you wanna look ☺️ https://t.co/0kLVspiqxv
