As we reflect on Pride Month, UAW 5810 renews our commitment to take intentional action towards progress and against hate at all times. We have more work to do to make UC safe and inclusive for all in the LGBTQIA+ community, and we are committed to seeing it through. #Pride #VOTE https://t.co/Uu63MuZ6uZ
