On #EpilepsyAwarenessDay, we honor Coach Jerry Kill, who has directly affected us in a beautiful way. 

Not only do you advocate for &amp; bring awareness of Epilepsy to college football, you show the ðŸŒŽ resiliency &amp; strength while being humble &amp; selfless. A true role model for all. https://t.co/aoxAFpviWA
