45 trans &amp; gender nonconforming people were murdered in the U.S. in 2020, the highest recorded.

2021 has seen a record number of anti-trans bills filed, many targeting trans youth. This is not a coincidence.

This #TransDayOfVisibility we reject hate &amp; honor our trans siblings. https://t.co/bhOKHQ2w7q
