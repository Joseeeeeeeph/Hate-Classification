#refugee #humanrights activists murder in #Europe &amp; #Canada is a matter of concern for all. Iâ€™ve written letters to #UK Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary &amp; South Asia Minister. I request all diaspora HR activists to write similar letters to them. #KarimaBaloch https://t.co/zcxYbxGugR
