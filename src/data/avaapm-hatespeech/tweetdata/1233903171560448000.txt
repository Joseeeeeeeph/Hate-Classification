My appreciation and gratitude for what this flag represents is deeper than just symbolism, it’s a way of life, a culture, pride, it’s my freedom. I’d die for it proudly and protect it daily for all that it’s done for me and even fellow Americans who can’t see it. #AmericaFirst https://t.co/rdlM0QKUw5
