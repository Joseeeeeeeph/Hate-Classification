‼️ Howard Turk jumped bail on a pending Capital Murder charge, after killing a man in a 2017 home invasion. 

Last week, Turk (a gang member) evaded arrest from officers after he was seen conducting surveillance on an ATM Technician. Turk was armed with a pistol at the time. ‼️ https://t.co/9kNHul3vZ6
