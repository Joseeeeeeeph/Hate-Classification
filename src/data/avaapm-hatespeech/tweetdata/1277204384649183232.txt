Guess who was born #OTD in 1491?

A turbulent, mercurial &amp; dangerous man who would:

- tear through the tissues of the church
- obsess over having a son
- bludgeon his way through 6 drama-filled marriages. 

Itâ€™s the monarch we all love to hate, #Henry8! Happy birthday, old chap! https://t.co/06upWepcB0
