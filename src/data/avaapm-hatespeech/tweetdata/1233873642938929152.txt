You know that time in church when the worship song really hits u in the chest but u don't want to cry cause "hard guy" so u just stop moving and fold ur arms and start thinking about how many times God came through for u?

Then you hit crescendo with the song right before it ends https://t.co/Lj6Xg2BG7C
