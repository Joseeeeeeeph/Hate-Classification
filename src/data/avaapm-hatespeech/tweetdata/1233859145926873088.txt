So proud of all of the ways we showed respect for Black History Month here at SMS.  The morning poems, quotes, and pictures displayed, honoring past and present African American leaders were amazing! We hope to do even more next year &amp; be mindful of the past always. @sps01907 https://t.co/TyOYU1lJHD
