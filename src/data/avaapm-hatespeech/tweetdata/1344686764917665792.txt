Take a second &amp; remember 1 of the greats, Roberto Clemente, killed on 12/31/72. Delivering supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua, his plane crashed into the Atlantic on take off due to engine failure. As complete a baseball player as there ever was but an even greater man. https://t.co/TsUoJg4dnh
