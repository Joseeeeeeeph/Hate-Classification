Interesting West African folklore from Ivory Coast ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡®

The sacrifice of Queen Aura Poku - who threw her infant child into the River Comoe so her â€˜Bauleâ€™ people can flee from their ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­â€˜Ashantiâ€™ enemies. 

I go into this historical story in chapter 6 of my book #TheAfricanUnderbelly https://t.co/7jzPdDFcNU
