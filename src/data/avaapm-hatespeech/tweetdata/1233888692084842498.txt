Nephew: Mimi I can’t go to church tomorrow, I gotta be at the gym by 12:45 for my game 

My mom: don’t play yourself, we get out at 11. &amp; You need to go so you can pray for a good game 

Him: But I can just pray now  

Mom: See, that’s exactly why your game sucks now ! 🤦🏾‍♀️ https://t.co/jFqpedwMdI
