In the Heimskringla Saga (The Norse Kings) we found a lot of references from the german Translator (Felix Niedner) that 'Blood-Falcons' or 'Battle-Swans' are Ciphers for Ravens! Some people saying #Valkyries are the Ravens! That means they could change their shape like Odin!! https://t.co/mMJ2qNFMUx
