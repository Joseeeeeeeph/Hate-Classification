Quote from Jesus Christ in the Gospel - Now is the Hour of the Evil One. Now is the Hour when those that are still in their Graves that hear the voice of God's only begotten Son ( the Son of Man ) will rise from their Graves. I will return in an Hour unknown to my Evil servants. https://t.co/Gq9ueAtcOt
