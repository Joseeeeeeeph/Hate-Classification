On this day in 1972, #RobertoClemente-future Hall of Fame baseball player-was killed along with 4 others when the cargo plane in which he was traveling crashed off the coast of Puerto Rico. Clemente was on his way to deliver relief supplies to an earthquake-devastated #Nicaragua. https://t.co/WG25yjhLxp
