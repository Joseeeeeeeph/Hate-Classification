337,419 covid-19 deaths in the USA 🇺🇸 
I don’t want to hear “but 99% survive”
all 337,419 who have died had family members &amp; friends who loved and miss them terribly 

our unsung heroes are our nurses,doctors,healthcare workers who’ve been at this for months &amp; no end in sight.... https://t.co/qTFF049T1o
