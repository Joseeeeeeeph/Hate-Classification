When in Warsaw, I recommend Warsaw Zoo. In WWII, zoo director, Jan Zabinski and his wife Antonina hid around 300 Jews in the zoo’s enclosures and their own villa. All but two survived the war. The zoo is a lovely day out and you can also visit the Zabinski’s villa, now a museum. https://t.co/GPwrBa0EBf
