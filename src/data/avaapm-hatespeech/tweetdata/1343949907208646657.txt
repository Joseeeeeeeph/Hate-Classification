Girl at War by @NovicSara is set in 1991. Ana Juric is a carefree tomboy, but when civil war breaks out across Yugoslavia, football games and school lessons are supplanted by sniper fire and air raid drills. Borrow from Stamford Hill or Stoke Newington https://t.co/LQwzbNT7hq https://t.co/HThPGHJrYB
