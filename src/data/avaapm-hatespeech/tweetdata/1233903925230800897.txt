Had a good day today, good to see old mates. Love my city, the sense of place and comradeship that football brings. Bootham Crescent is the heart of that. Glad it's getting some attention these days but never, never forget how we were robbed of it... #ycfc #photography #football https://t.co/z3e8ETUklR
