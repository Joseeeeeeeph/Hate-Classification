"Canadians of African Descent: Going forward, guided by the past." @WRPSToday was honoured to attend the Black History Month event today in Cambridge. Amazing people, performances, dialogue, reflection, food &amp; friendship. Thank you for the warm welcome. #BlackHistoryCambridge https://t.co/yn3qgye6G4
