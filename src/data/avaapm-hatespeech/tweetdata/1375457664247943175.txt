Over the next two weeks, our district will be honoring Vietnam Veterans before baseball &amp; softball games as part of National Vietnam War Veterans Day to be recognized on March 29. 

Last evening Superintendent Hanna visited the Leon vs Lincoln baseball game and the Rickards game. https://t.co/1IwaNxk3bJ
