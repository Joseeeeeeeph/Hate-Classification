2-2 going into 3rd between #Sweden &amp; #Russia. Swedes took over in 2nd with the help of Russian penalties. 
Larionov wonâ€™t be happy with the lack of discipline on some.
Askarov needs to stand tall in 3rd.
The #Oilers Broberg is not skating as well as he was. Probably injured. https://t.co/Vap11uffGR
