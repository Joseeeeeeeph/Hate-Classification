We had our first OB appointment today! 🎉
Check out baby Roh already working on their jump shot.. 🏀 
I now am transitioned to a normal OB patient and will be seen once a month. We’re planning on doing a zoom gender reveal on April 17th when we hit the 2nd trimester!
Stay tuned! https://t.co/DNqoFLOAs2
