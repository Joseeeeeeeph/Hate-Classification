A couple of great artifacts you’ll see displayed in our visitor center when you visit James A. Garfield NHS: the Bible on which Garfield took the presidential oath; and the hat he was wearing the day he was shot. And so much more! Better put us on your “must see in 2021” list! https://t.co/9bKVq7OPmq
