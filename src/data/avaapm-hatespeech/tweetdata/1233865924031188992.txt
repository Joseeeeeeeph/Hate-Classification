Had the best time this afternoon at Archangel Michael Greek festival. The food was extraordinary - gyros, souvlakia, moussaka and spanakopita in addition to bags of koulourakia, baklava and Easter bread. Thank you @ButcherBadurik for telling us about this awesomeness! #GreekFest https://t.co/tCvGLEGSs5
