From memories of Kulner, a German witness on #Baku in 1925:

“#Armenians attacked Muslim (Azerbaijani) settlements, killing everybody. Several days after the genocide, corpses of Azerbaijanis were pulled out from a groove. Armenians showed no mercy to children and elderly people” https://t.co/LwRvlUm3GU
