It’s been a difficult year but I’m still grateful for everything I have &amp; for all those around me. My work around refugees &amp; the Bosnian genocide is a constant reminder not to take anything for granted. I’m proud to have taken part/organised more than 70 live events this year... https://t.co/g3T5p7nf0T
