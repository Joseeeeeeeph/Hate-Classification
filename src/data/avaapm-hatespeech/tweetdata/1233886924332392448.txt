Today I watched Medicine for Melancholy, directed by Barry Jenkins, and which I checked out from Colorado's Jefferson County Public Library @cojeffcolibrary.

Beautifully conceived, shot, and acted. Great film about San Fran, the African American experience, &amp; indie pop culture. https://t.co/SrwLXPfgOt
