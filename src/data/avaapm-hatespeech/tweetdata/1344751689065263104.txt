Male that attacked Vapour (and three officers!) with a baseball bat was charged and remanded, and plead guilty at court to 1 x Attempt crim dam for the attack on the dog, and 3 counts of Assault Emergency Worker. Thanks to colleagues in @Coventry_Police who ran the investigation. https://t.co/aZnb0fli4x
