Tide comes every 19th to fill up Church’s basement, leaves by 21st. During, there’s whispers, screams. After, things left behind. Some dead, some alive. Alive ones try to talk. We don’t know what they say. There’s pleading in their voice. We eat them all the same. [Oleg Vdovenko] https://t.co/4QtAxZsBDn
