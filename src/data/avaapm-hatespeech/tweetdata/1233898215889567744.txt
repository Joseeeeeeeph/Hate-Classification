Congratulations to #FCFRD Fairfax Fire flag football team that won the @InovaHealth Hero Bowl for the second year in a row. The competition was held among regional fire and rescue departments. They went undefeated with no team scoring points against them to retain their title! https://t.co/PVf0Hj3PkJ
