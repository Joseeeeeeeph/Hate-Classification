A Black transgender woman was shot and killed in Chicago on Christmas Day. Courtney "Eshay" Key was 25.

She is at least the 43rd trans or gender nonconforming person killed in 2020. Family and friends told @cbschicago police repeatedly misgendered her, calling it "dehumanizing." https://t.co/NrI0bFLos0
