Listening to the Angelus at the Sagrada Familia in February was a beautiful experience for me in 2020 inspiring  this epitaph for 2020 as we say farewell: 

"We live in the spirit but we die in the flesh"

Gaudi is buried beneath his bible-in-stone creation to make this point :-) https://t.co/PcieM8Ld1W
