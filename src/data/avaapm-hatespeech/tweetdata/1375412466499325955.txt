Please Power Up in prayer for the family of Oscar Frayer. The Grand Canyon basketball player was killed in a car accident Tuesday. His sister and another person in the car also lost their lives. Please remember the basketball family and the university as well in your prayers. https://t.co/ayibPBugOb
