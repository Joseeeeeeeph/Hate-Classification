Reading around, glad to see the name Sue Hammersley. A most fabulous and brilliant priest, and one with which I have yet to see a match. IIRC, she opened that Sunday with 'Despite what you might have heard on radio 4 this morning, I haven't declared war on the Church of England.' https://t.co/ievZ41XIUA
