Aden, one of Yemen's two major airports, was hit by a terrorist attack on December 30. The goal of the terrorists was apparently to kill the country's new coalition government's most senior people, including the Prime Minister. They failed, but 26 died. https://t.co/DaF08M4ulN https://t.co/ERQfsvY8SF
