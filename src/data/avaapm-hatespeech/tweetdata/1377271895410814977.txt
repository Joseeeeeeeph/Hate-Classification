I'd like to wish a beautiful, joyful, powerful day to my trans comrades out there. The world is fucking hard, but you're harder and stronger and I love you with all my weird little queer being

One day we'll bathe in bourgeoisie blood together and rejoice #TransDayOfVisibility https://t.co/2aBFT1kbOg
