Today I put on bracelets for maybe the 2nd time all pandemic- a thin gold one from my Armenian grandma who died almost 60 yrs ago; another from my 97 y.o. aunt who always off-loads things to me. Life is larger than its immediate sorrows. Wishing you a 2021 full of bracelets!ðŸ’›ðŸ¥³ https://t.co/F3uOQ1Wu6c
