Great to visit Opotiki this week to celebrate the introduction of the Organic Products Bill to Parliament.

The Bill aims to grow consumer confidence when purchasing organic products, allow businesses to make claims that their products are organic with certainty, and boost trade. https://t.co/reYk1X6YJr
