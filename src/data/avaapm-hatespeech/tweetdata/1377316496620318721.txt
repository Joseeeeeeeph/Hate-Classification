The CIA tried to assassinate Fidel Castro around 634 times &amp; failed each time.

Castro will forever be remembered as true friend of Africa, who stood by Africans during their campaigns &amp; fights against the western imperialists invasion, colonization &amp; apartheid meted out to them. https://t.co/44UpnnS1pw
