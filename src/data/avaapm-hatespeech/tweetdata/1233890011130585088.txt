I had a great time with the @MCScots Women’s Basketball team this weekend on the IG Takeover.  It was an honor to serve @coachtravillian, @J_Ballard13, and all the student-athletes this season. I love what I do and they make me love it more! I’m proud to be a Scot! #ScotsNation https://t.co/7I6sFru9kN
