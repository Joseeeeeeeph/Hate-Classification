7-yo K filling out her “Very First School Book”:
K: So I choose?
Sister, 9: Yes. 
K: Just one?  
S: Yes... 
(silence, then chooses “boy”, not her biological gender)
S: But hey, these other questions are really silly too. Do you have a moustache? A wooden leg 😆? 
Love these kids! https://t.co/ayAa4zZAT9
