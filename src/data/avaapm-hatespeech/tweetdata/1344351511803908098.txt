Fare thee well, Grigori #Rasputin. Due to his influence over the tsarina, he was murdered by #Russian conservatives #onthisday in 1916.

First he was offered poisoned wine and cakes. After partaking he was still unfazed and unharmed. So they shot him and left him in a basement. https://t.co/YHrnJSWyAc
