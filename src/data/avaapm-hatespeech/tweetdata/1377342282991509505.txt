Happy 90th birthday to the late Gene Snyder.  A military veteran during the Korean War, Snyder was traded to the Dodgers in 1958 as part of the deal that sent Sparky Anderson to the Phillies.  He played all 11 games of his MLB career with LA in 1959, finishing with a 1-1 record. https://t.co/dGP52PGaln
