29 Feb 1940: Hattie #McDaniel becomes the first African-American #actress to win an Oscar.  She won for her supporting role as Mammy in Gone with The Wind. She was racially segregated from her co-stars at the awards ceremony and had to sit at a table in the back of the room. #OTD https://t.co/51sdN3EmEh
