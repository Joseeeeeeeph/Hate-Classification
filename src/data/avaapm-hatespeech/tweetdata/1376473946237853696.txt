An EASTER reminder: The ‘CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT’ of EVIL is not Hitler or Stalin or capitalism or Marxism or racism or homophobia or slavery or oppression. It was the killing of the ONE innocent Son of God – Jesus the Messiah. IT FAILED, for Jesus is alive. Anyone may look to Him! https://t.co/L2CNyJOGn6
