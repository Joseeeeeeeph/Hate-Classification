Kieran, @RTECeiliHouse hit the nail on the head. Me and @daoiri have been going through a tough time lately - he just won't move to Wexford. We can't keep this long distance stuff up.. ðŸ˜‚ come see us "break up" tomorrow at 3 in St Iberius Church Wexford. @MGWexford @visitwexford https://t.co/9pm7AuwcpA
