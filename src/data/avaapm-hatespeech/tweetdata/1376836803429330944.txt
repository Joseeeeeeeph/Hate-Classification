#OTD 1918.  British RFC ace Alan Jerrard VC (with 7 victories) runs out of  luck. Shot down by German ace Benno Ritter von Fernbrugg, he is taken captive. Jerrard remained a POW until his escape in November, whereupon he took to the skies for the newly formed RAF  - in Russia. https://t.co/1QEijIeZ25
