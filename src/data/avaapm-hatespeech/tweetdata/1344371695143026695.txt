Srs. Pat Dual, Margie Davis &amp; Gemma Doll joined people of faith at the Washington Glidden Social Justice Park in Columbus, OH, to call for an end to police killings. This month 2 African-American men were killed by police. May God hear the cries of the suffering. #BePeace https://t.co/mGBwcr2gPR
