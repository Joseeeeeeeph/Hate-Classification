How are we?

We've had almost every player injured for spells during the season. We've seen Thiago kick a ball for us only 3x, how good is he though? Keep him fit and we walk the league. VVD &amp; Jota to return. Top of the table going into 2021. And current CHAMPIONS!! Yes Reds!! https://t.co/wAm9cLHPqM
