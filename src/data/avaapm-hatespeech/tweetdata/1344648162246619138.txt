Tune in at 4pm EST today on ESPN for the @AZOLibertyBowl for a fun matchup between @ArmyWP_Football and @WVUfootball!

Army’s option attack is tough to prepare for on short notice and WVU is very talented. Love their RB Brown and DT Stills (who doesn’t!?). Will be a good one! https://t.co/nPxRg6Vn70
