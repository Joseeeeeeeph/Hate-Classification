Save our Karen.
I'm a Karen woman too but I live in another city. As far as I can I speak out to my ethnicity. Now they're in war zone. Min Aung Hlaing's military are very rude so they have left their hometown. Now they're refugees. Please save our Karen ppl. #savekarenpeople https://t.co/sKGIipbolT
