Powerful message today from @DamonWest7 — author of “The Coffee Bean.” From college football star to meth addict and convicted felon, he explained how to change a pot of boiling water (LIFE) into a pot of coffee. Highly recommend the extended cut on Vimeo. https://t.co/ySTK2fwB8x https://t.co/IEJ1djfQ2m
