Happy Jubilee weekend! It was an honor &amp; pleasure introducing this incredible voting rights panel right here in my HOME church, Brown Chapel Church in Selma! Thank you to Vanita Gupta, Sam Levine, Joyce Vance, Raquel Wright and Leah Aden for such an inspiring panel discussion. https://t.co/3YzhNlutyO
