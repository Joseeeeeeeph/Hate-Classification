Finished this last night. Some heroic Americans. 

Favorite story is Daniel Webster Wallace. Born into slavery &amp; died in 1939 a millionaire &amp; one of the wealthiest ranchers in Texas.

He even donated money for a white church to build a building...during segregation. What a man! https://t.co/gyzOiAchh3
