“He (Jesus) said to them (His disciples),to you it has been given to come progressively to know,understand more strongly the mysteries &amp; secrets of the kingdom of God.But for others they are in parables,so that though looking,they may not see; &amp; hearing, they may not comprehend.” https://t.co/GVN2JQvLLy
