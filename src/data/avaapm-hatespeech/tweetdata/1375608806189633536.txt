The Bell's of baseball , Gus , Buddy , David and Mike , sad to hear that bench coach of the Twins Mike Bell passed away today at 46 from a short illness of battling the Big C. In my opinion that sucks to die at that age and of that disease and only wish his entire family the best https://t.co/AfIgjehlUb
