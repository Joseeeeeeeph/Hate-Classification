Today is the 76th anniversary of the day General Maurice Rose, then the highest ranking Jewish officer in the U.S. army (and our namesake), was killed in action.

We honor the life of General Rose every day through our ongoing commitment to justice, inclusivity and diversity. https://t.co/iklCsQEEfe
