I know it probably sounds silly but, being half Indian and half a Scotch/Irish/German mix, one of the reasons I love Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer is the way it's a Gothic novel that plays with the boundaries of time and space, jumping from Ireland to India to Spain and back. https://t.co/gELP4QD89E
