Today was magic- I got to vote for @BrianCarrollSFV (YAY)&amp; @ewarren. I wore white in remembrance of all who fought, sacrificed, &amp; suffered so all women could vote- especially Alice Paul, Ida B Wells, Belle Squire, Susan B Anthony, Emmeline Pankhurst, &amp; Mary Church Terrell. #LFG https://t.co/mX74y3sFYL
