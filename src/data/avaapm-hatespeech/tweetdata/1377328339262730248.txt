The partner of a Salvadoran refugee who died in police custody in Mexico was arrested for abuse.

#VictoriaSalazar was 36. An autopsy found her neck broken.

El Salvador's president says the man abused Salazar's daughter and she reported him weeks ago, but "nothing was done." https://t.co/dDHK1fkxzw
