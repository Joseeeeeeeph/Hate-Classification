According to Steam, #BaldursGate3 is going to be localized in different languages (8 until now) but only the text and not the voices.
Divine Divinity was completely localized into German with in 2002, 18 years ago. 
Are we going to get @baldursgate3 localized in text and sound? https://t.co/ykI9PWLNkP
