Hans Christian Andersen’s ‘The Nightingale’ tells the story of an emperor who prefers the tinkling of a bejeweled mechanical bird to the song of a real nightingale. When he’s about to die, the nightingale's song brings him back to health. @EnchantedEzine #FairyTaleTuesday #birds https://t.co/lbGTvhQpwL
