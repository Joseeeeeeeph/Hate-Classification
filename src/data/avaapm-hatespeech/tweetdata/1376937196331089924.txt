Antyesti means “last sacrifice”, and refers to the funeral rites for the dead in Hinduism. In Hindu text the human body and the universe consist of five elements: air, water, fire, earth, and space. The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and its origins. https://t.co/OUktb7WEf7
