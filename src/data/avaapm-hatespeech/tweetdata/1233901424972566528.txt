Tomorrow marks the 55th anniversary of Bloody Sunday -- when hundreds of African Americans calling for voting rights faced violence. Their bravery inspired marches across the country and the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Every year we honor those who crossed at the Jubilee. https://t.co/TKBti0Wmj9
