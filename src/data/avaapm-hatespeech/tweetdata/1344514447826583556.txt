Game 121: Dallas Cowboys @ Indianapolis Colts. Super Bowl 5 revenge... sorta. Below-average offense for the Cowboys. A late 2Q pick game me another TD. Late 4Q, Tolbert sacked Jeff George on 4th down, ending the game. Team had 7 sacks, 2 by me. Final score: 35-6. #TecmoSNES2021 https://t.co/6Tw28Zz9OQ
