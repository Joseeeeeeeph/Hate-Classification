Well 1-4 the league, but 3 matchs were very very close. I think the deck is really good, like really good but like, getting unmoored ego game 1 or discard + surgical when you will T3 kill. Or drawing thassa's oracle and getting it discard then exile by kaya's guile. Bad run :( https://t.co/7CONebNwGh
