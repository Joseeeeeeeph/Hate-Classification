Newbery Honor Author, @jasminewarga speaks to WMS @WyomingCity 7th &amp; 8th graders about her book Other Words for Home—beautifully written in verse, about a young Syrian refugee. Stressed the importance of empathy in literature &amp; it’s okay to be bored! Thanks for #ImpactWyoming https://t.co/MPu1FsgzFZ
