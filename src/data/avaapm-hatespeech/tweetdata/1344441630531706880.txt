This is my father. He is the soldier with the rifle &amp; cigarette transporting German prisoners of war through Ulm Germany. He was not a sucker &amp; far from a loser. He served the country he loved with pride. He was &amp; will always be my hero. Trump canâ€™t shine his shoes. https://t.co/myDJliLpae
