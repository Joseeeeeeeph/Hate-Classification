I've been sitting around with an injured foot most of the week and thought I'd up my @ScotsGaelicDuo practice so as to feel productive. Got a bit carried away. Got into a heated rivalry which saw me spending FIVE SOLID HOURS desperately trying to win the League table last night. https://t.co/W4e4f8Gyir
