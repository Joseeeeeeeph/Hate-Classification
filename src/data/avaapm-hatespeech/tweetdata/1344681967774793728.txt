Joyriding quad bikes last night. Field gate propped open. Pregnant cows escaped ran a mile or so along main road but thankfully then into our field nr Church, whilst others were found nearby eating yew trees which can kill. Stressful &amp; hazardous #ruralcrime #BackBritishFarming https://t.co/2z8oldYq5R
