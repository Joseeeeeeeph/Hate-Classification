I adored John Fitzpatrick. His football &amp; never-say-die spirit epitomised the attitude of the Stretford End &amp; his Rolling Stones haircut the spirit of the '60s. I daubed 'FITZ' on the back of my combat jacket at 13 to look hard &amp; express my rebelliousness. Well done Aberdeen Reds https://t.co/Rkd8ySqni4
