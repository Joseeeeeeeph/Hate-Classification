Honestly, @SenateGOP &amp; @HouseGOP refuse to help($$$)states administer COVID-19 vaccines while trump’s administration says it’s up to states to administer. 

America broke another record of COVID-19 deaths yesterday, 3,800+ Americans died. 

Republican leaders want you to die. https://t.co/7NsR7aQLwV
