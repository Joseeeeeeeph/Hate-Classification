A while back we looked at a wonderful old #postcard of George Minister &amp; his family. Well, the little boy Arthur (1893-1957) grew to be 5ft 11.5 inches, became a #policeman &amp; served in the First World War. We studied him &amp; other Kelsall men who fought as part of a project in 2011 https://t.co/zTBJFOQU4i
