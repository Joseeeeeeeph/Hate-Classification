As an explainer: I feel like many people think war with Iran could only happen if Trump decides to bomb Iran. Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy force, in a very tense, decades-long standoff with Israel, a U.S. ally. If hostilities explode there, we'll almost certainly be dragged in. https://t.co/EZosJ7i7Hk
