Testing out a new shot after the football game. Actually, this is one of two new ones we’re going to try, so let’s hope we do t go on too late. 

The game is a blowout from what I can see. Aso from what I can see, my friend Kevin Connors over at ESPN is one happy guy tonight. https://t.co/0At6V7Etz3
