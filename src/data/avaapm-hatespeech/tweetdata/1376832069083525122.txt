This beautifully decorated #manuscript is a late-15th c. edition of Terence's Comedies.

The Roman-African playwright, whose plays were performed around 170-160 BC, lived part of his life as a slave in Rome. 

Freed for his writing abilities, Terence died at only 25 years old. https://t.co/cdvHgtvrlY
