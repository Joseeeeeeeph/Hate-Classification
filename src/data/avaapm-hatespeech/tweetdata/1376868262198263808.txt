JESUS CHRIST died on the cross for our sins so that we may be forgiven. All who believe in HIM shall not die but have everlasting life! If you believe, THE HOLY SPIRIT dwells in you to guide your steps. All other religions you have to prove your love. JESUS died for you already! https://t.co/mi4ffsujlq
