President Museveni: "I talked to deceased Zebra Ssenyange's wife who said soldiers entered Zebra's house but he had gone. He climbed &amp; jumped over a fence. That's how he fell into the other group &amp; was shot twice. I am very sorry about this. I am going to investigate this. https://t.co/nZXlBgTkxI
