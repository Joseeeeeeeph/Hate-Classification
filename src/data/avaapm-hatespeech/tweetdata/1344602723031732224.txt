The Hindu temple which was vandalized yesterday in Pakistan, distributed ration worth thousands of dollars to the locals irrespective of faith during the pandemic.
Hindus were donating generously to this temple to help the mankind.
Mughals used to destroy Hindus temples in India. https://t.co/72UnTeQCK9
