Celebrating #BlackHistoryMonth w/ a few of our exemplary neighbors who make our community better— one church service, one civic meeting, one hot meal, or one hair cut at a time 🙌🏽 Thanks to @QueensMuseum, all who attended &amp; Keica’s Catering for the delicious soul food! #SeenIn13 https://t.co/h5iQgcazX3
