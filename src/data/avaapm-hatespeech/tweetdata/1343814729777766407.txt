Busy night in Coventry... At a domestic incident, male tries to attack officers and PD Vapour with a baseball bat - fortunately Vapour is too quick for him and quickly comes out on top with help from @ResponseWMP . One in custody - no injuries to dog, minor injury to one officer https://t.co/bSeZcVmTtS
