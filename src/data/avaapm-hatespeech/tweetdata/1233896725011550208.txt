This cancer cure cover-up has to stop. I just lost another friend to cancer. A cure was discovered in the 1930's and the cover-up continues. Why hasn't  the American Cancer Society discovered a cure? They take in millions every year.  Can someone get this info to our president? https://t.co/GxKSwh4iBf
