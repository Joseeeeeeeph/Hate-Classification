hey y’all, i was rewatching episode 8 (😭) and at the end we see this shot of gretchen which mirrors traditional catholic imagery of holy people, showing light coming from behind their head, it seems like it’s a reference to gretchen playing god with the girls’ lives. thoughts? https://t.co/PStgRnebr9
