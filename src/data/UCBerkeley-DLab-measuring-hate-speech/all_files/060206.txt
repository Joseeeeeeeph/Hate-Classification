lgbtq isnt an exclusive group that you need a membership for you can still be an ally no matter what the orientation is and you are under no obligation to do anything different just because you identify with the community be supportive find yourself along the way and dont label yourself just so you can fit in with a group you fit in if you think that everyone is a human and recognize there is still an imbalance in equality between us and society and hope for a better future no id cards or tests of faith required just open and honest you
