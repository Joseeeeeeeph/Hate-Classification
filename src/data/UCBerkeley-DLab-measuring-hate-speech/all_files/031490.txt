people seem to think cuban is an ethnicity when its as much so as american is there are white cubans hispanic cubans black cubans and native cubans so cuban really just means im either first or second generation american in that context but they definitely side conservative largely bc liberals seem to praise the cuban government for superficial reasons particularly castro when he died and former cubans know the worst of it
