being trans in sweden is ok but we have to deal with so much bureaucracy when we turn to the trans specific healthcare theres a lot of waiting involved i reached out to a gender therapist in mid 2016 and waited two years for hormones and 25 3 years for top surgery and legal gender reassignment that sucks when you just need help to live your life as yourself
