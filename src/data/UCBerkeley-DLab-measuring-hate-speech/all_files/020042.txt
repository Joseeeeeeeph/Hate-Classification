canada has sold out to foreign dirty money and its sad all you have to do is look at every place where theres chinatowns and mainland chinese that buy up properties and youll see that they have zero western values and will continue to do this shit ​ i worked in china for years and even in the most luxurious malls youd have people having their kids pee or poop in a bag while the bathroom is fuckin 50 feet away ​ this is the very fundamentals of chinese business cut all the costs you can i worked with loads of chinese businesses and not a single time did they not try to rip me off
