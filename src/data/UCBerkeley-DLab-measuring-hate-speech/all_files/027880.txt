thanks i was also wondering as far as your question goes im not aware of any published conversations on the subject but coming from a place of anecdotal evidence among my friends that does seem to be the case its not a geirus lchumra but of the zera yisrael i know that started becoming more religious before understanding their status and then continued on once they understood it their batei din were all much more lenient with them than they generally were with out of the blue converts
