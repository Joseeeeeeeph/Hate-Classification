im happy that youre happy all too often theres so much drama and in fighting as if dealing with the outside homophobic and heteronormative world wasnt enough it personally took me a while to be happy and i had a lot of growing up to do i was really fortunate that i had good gay peeps in my life that were willing to listen and be there and i hope every young gayby gets the same opportunities enjoy pride month man its gonna be a blast
