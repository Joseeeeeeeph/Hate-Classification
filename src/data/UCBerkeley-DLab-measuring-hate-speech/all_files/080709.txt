thats what happens when you define entire ethnicities as subhuman and not worthy of life like the nazis did with slavs roma etc lets remember that only *starting* the generalplan osturl brought to the death of 9 to 11 million slavs but the policy was designed to be gradually implemented over the course of about 30 years and would have brought to the death of various other tens of millions of slavs if the war would have continued
