i know how you feel and i hate how this stuff is tearing apart wlw friendships im a lesbian my first in real life gender critical friend was bi but i also know so many bi women and even lesbians who are into all the gender crazy stuff its a very difficult terrain to navigate no matter what the issue is having to choose between keeping quiet and feeling angryguilty all the time or speaking up and losing friends and potentially having other bad shit happen to you is so painful
