so you admit that religion is made up bullshit to keep stupid people in line the books can not be updated because if they are weak enough to change with various contemporary whims then they would lose their authority and therefor lose their transmissibility thank you for demonstrating how religion has fucked up your mind these books would have an iota of authority if their claimed morality matched our society since it doesnt its clear that they are a product of the fucked up minds of middle eastern savages
