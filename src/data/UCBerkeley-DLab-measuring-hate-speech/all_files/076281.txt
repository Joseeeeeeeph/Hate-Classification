i totally agree on the point that the views of the kashmiris were not considered and whole of the kashmir was kept under a close eye before passing this decision this should be a welcome move as now kashmir will be truly a part of india it will work in similar fashion as other ut such as delhi pondicherry etc are working now india is open to kashmiris and kashmir is truly open to india i would suggest all to wait and then react as this can turn out to be positive for all the region
