my boyfriend used to work in hollywood studios while waiting in line for tot a cast member stopped us and talked to my boyfriend for a little bit then she told us that we didnt have to wait in line and gave us fastpasses the wait was 120 minutes i really wanted to give her a hug not really an experience but theres a trans bellhop and whenever i see her it makes me smile and appreciate the fact that disney is 100% fine with trans people and that the world in general is more accepting of lgbt individuals apparently shes a really nice person too
