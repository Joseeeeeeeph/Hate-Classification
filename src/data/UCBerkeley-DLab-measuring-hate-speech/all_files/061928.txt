honestly it just doesnt feel like im allowed to feel anything about it as its a crime to be gay where i live so i try not to think about i wish i could go out to a club dance to a donna summer song and snag a guy to celebrate this month but no thats not an option if you have the opportunity to celebrate it please do so for yourself and for everyone who cant this includes a 30 year old chub that cant because of where he is
