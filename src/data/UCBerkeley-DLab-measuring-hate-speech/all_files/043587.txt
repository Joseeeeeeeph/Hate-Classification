have you come out to your wife at all what was that experience like if you did im open with my girlfriend and i actually made a decision at some point after i admitted to myself that i was bisexual that i would tell all the people i dated from the get go so far that has worked out for me i really got lucky with my current relationships as she describes herself as fluid and is open to dating other women herself
