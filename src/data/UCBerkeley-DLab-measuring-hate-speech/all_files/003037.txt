i wasnt even out when i felt like a lesbian first i was like hey i dont like dating straight women then i was dating bi and pan women but i was like i dont want to be a man in any relationship and finally im gey and i smooch lesbians and i have a gay ass girlfriend i think it was the relief of my dysphoria that made me feel more comfortable with my sexual identity
