im not jewish and not keen on religion but have a soft spot for judaism over other religions maybe its because ive been exposed to the religious holidays through my elementary school my first memory of a holiday activity was making a paper draedel in school and singing the song as well as learning about passover the food is quite good too i hope judaism stays because people want the traditions to be kept alive though
