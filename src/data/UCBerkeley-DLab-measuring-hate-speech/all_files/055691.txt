youre getting downvoted but based on my own experience you are 100% correct i have plenty of non white american friends who were not treated the same way as me while in asia all of us though regardless of our skin color and regardless of our 100% legal status in the country at some point or another were told to go home do you think it will ever be possible for humanity in general to overcome such attitudes toward foreigners do you feel that it should or that its even a goal worth striving for
