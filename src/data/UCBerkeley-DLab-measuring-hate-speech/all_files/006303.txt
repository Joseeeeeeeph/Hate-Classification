that sounds really nice actually 30 years thought holy fuck have times changed from when you got together to now how did you meet and what business are you in one of the things that scares me about gay people is how i see them as other and not a part of society even though i know a gay couple and they are sort of part of a family i have in my head that you have to leave your family and everything you love and become a different person
