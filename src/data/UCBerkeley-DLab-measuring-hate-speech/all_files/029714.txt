yeah that too plus i dont know about you but as i grow older i kinda get tired of these people talking about their gayness all the time in all circumstances i got hobbies defining me way more than my sexuality i know a guy who talks constantly about it about his sex life about his weird hook ups on grindr in a desperate effort to shock the audience or make himself interesting and its just obnoxious to me what im looking for in a good gay character is a character whos interesting in other fields not just a giant billboard constantly referencing who he bangs all the time
