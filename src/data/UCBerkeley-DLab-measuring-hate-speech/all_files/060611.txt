i would say follow your heart because it is really worth it i dealt with debilitating depression and anxiety for close to 10 years due to repressing my true self things didnt suddenly become perfect overnight but since accepting i am gay i am happy for the first time since i was a teenager it took me some time to get there but it has been so worth it to be happy being my true self plus have you seen girls they are so pretty and wonderful and i get to date them now which is pretty freaking awesome
