i never really had to prove myself persayi am a lutheran from the missouri senate and they have been alot more liberal then other faiths my pastor did resign shortly afterwards and i do believe people in the congregation asked him too the new pastor is nice and friendly but i actually enjoy the old pastors sermons better its the people you surround yourself with the people that care about you that makes the difference in the world
