congrats on coming out cloverbryan your experience was very enlightening to me id known of nonbinary people who use different names to suit the gender at present but i didnt realise how deep the change goes for me i am just genderqueer lem and sometimes lem wants a beard and to wear neckties and other times a pair of heels and some boobs but at the core i am still lem the concept of a second persona especially outside of the context of did is fascinating to me and im so happy youre able to more fully express all of yourself
