your point is both very valid and completely void in my mind i understand why people might think this way but in my mind its really backwards considering the fact that both men and women should be equal in a modern society its not that women should have better rights for a time to make up for lost rights historically its more that we should just work towards a point where everyone is just judged on their own merits doesnt really matter if you are male or female in my mind some people do some things better than others regardless of the genitals
