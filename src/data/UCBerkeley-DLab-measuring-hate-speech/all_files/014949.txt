does your sexual orientation really define who you are to that extreme id think for most people they simply arent interested in sexual orientation for them it doesnt have a place in normal conversation they cant relate to your experiences or why you feel the need to share it with them and so it comes off as awkward to them but i have seen a few lgbt guilds out there maybe you should consider joining one of those
