hmm all i can say really is go with your heart if that leads you to living the life of a cis person then go ahead youre valid either way if that means transitioning then do that its about what you want to do theres reason to be fearful about whether you are or arent just be you of course it will take a while to discover who you are but it takes everyone a while i wish you the best of luck
