you will always be my son is exactly how my mother would handle it she said you will always be catholic when i converted to judaism my advice is this dont struggle to gain acceptance from family members you are an adult or will be one someday and the only person that truly matters is you when you worry get frustrated and even change plans because of anyone you are giving that person or group of people too much power be yourself and youll be a much happier healthier person
