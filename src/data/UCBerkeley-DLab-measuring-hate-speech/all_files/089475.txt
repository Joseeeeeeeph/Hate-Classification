in my opinion it is okay to be bisexual and to act on same sex feelings if you are married to your partner but since you are married to your wife devote your life to her if polygamy was somehow legal in your country and your wife did not have any problem with you liking men or having a second partner in my opinion it would be completely okay to marry a second partner and do whatever you want or if you were married to a man instead of a woman thats how i feel at least
