despite having a half lebanese girlfriend and her lebanese father in my life for the last seven years arab culture and language is still difficult for me she says things to me in arabic i understand we cook and eat the food all of the time but a lot of things dont stick ive been dying to go to lebanon with them but it hasnt happened compare this to the seven years i spent with my puerto rican girlfriend and lived in south florida all of my life up until a year ago so 32 years i could make my way through central and south america with zero issue
