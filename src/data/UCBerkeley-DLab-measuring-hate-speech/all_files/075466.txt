 given that i am currently a minor no sensible rabbi will convert you anyways ill have to convert reform or conservative because ill at least get more knowledge about the religion and learn traditions which is an exciting process on its own this is a huge red flag each movement has different mutually exclusive theologies so treating these as stepping stones will set you back but yes judaism and orthodoxy in particular is highly communal and you need to live in a community
