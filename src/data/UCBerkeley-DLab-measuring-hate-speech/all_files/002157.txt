sentimental problems because lets be real i never meet a girl that was able to give me the right advice with another girl anyway except this personal inconvenient i am more open to share information with woman then males the point is that i usually notice that woman take care about what is my point of view and they understand not only what im saying but why im saying with males the conversation is a bit different and i feel like i dont like share too much of myself so i can defiantly say that what i share with male i share with female
