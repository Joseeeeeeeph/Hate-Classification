nta but i must admit that i just went along with it for both of my kids im not religious nor is my wife but she was raised catholic and her whole family is still quite religious so we go through all this bs to make her parents happy i say some ritualistic stuff and then get along with my life i was not struck by lightning i dont really consider christening to be a big deal and have no desire to do all that communion and confirmation crap â€‹ once my kids get a little older ill let them figure it out on their own maybe they will become religious to spite me but we shall see
