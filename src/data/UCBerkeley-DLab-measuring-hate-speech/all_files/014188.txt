i love this song because it tells you no matter who you are our what you are were all different at the end of the day we are all human and we are all discriminating each other over the color of our skin our how we dress we should treat each other with respect and the way we would like to be treated its 2019 can we just respect each other their is already so much bad in this world of ours im sure we dont want any more the point of this song is that we should stop judging people and get on with our own business if your still reading this i hope you have an amazing day
