i loved this movie octavia spencers acting was superb it really spoke to the unique alienation of a black woman in the world in general but especially in predominately caucasian settings  being belittled at work being forced into a maternal role regardless of the circumstances not being seen as a viable romantic partner being isolated from social groups while black men are able to fit in by conforming to stereotypes of coolness athleticism and sexual prowess and being forced to rear children alone very unique perspective for a horror movie
