hi and welcome reverse for me actually though the rules have changed for me lately overall i prefer women for everything and i have gotten into moods where i crave men physically but recently i have acknowledged my bisexuality which has given a sort of new vigor in my pursuit of the same sex so i am driven to concentrate exclusively on that for now so yes its entirely possible and allowed to be attracted to both sexes but for different reasons
