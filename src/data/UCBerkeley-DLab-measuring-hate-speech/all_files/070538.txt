hi sister dont worry about what people may or may not think our purpose as muslims is to please allah and not his creation i cant say that i can relate because i was born a native arabic speaker in a muslim family allah is the most just so any hardship you go through in order to practice allahs true religion verily will be rewarded i ask that allah makes it easy on you and reward you for all the effort you put to please him ameen
