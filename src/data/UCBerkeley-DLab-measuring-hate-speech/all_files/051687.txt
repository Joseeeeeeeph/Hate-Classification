sincere question what is parsi communitys views on bjp and modi overall also for fadnavis the recent issue about temple and metro has made a headlines and made me believe parsis have strongly become anti bjp but when the issue was resolved by metro guys making extra post sc order changes to metro line hardly any media covered it is there any changes in the views after it i had some parsi friends in my childhood so im eager to know about it
