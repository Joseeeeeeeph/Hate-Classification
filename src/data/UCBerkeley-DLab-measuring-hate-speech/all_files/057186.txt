the reason why you find it okay is because you and your friend have a mutual understanding with each other now try doing the same in front of an indian stranger the fact of the matter is different people have different level of tolerance towards stereotyping and this affects their understanding of what constitutes casual racism so when dealing with the public its best to prepare for the worst sometimes you can get away with it but things like this can happen too
