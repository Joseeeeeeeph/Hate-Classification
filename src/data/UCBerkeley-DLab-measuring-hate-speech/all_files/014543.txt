if a gay person said that they were uncomfortable with watching heterosexual sex scenes most of us would consider that okay you dont even need discomfort i am not *uncomfortable* watching heterosexual sex scenes but straight sex does nothing for me and each year you can count with your fingers the number of movies where the sex scene is plot relevant in any way so i would be perfectly happy with watching over 95 of the movies that have them with the sex scenes removed
