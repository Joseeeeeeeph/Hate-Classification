why isnt the focus on latino nations think about that there is a fairly obvious racism when you cant demand that latino nations take care of their own people when you expect whites to shoulder the burdens you are really saying that only whites are capable of being held to a high standard only if i felt a group was inherently incapable of self care would i demand others step up so clearly the corporate media beleives that latinos are children who whites must take in
