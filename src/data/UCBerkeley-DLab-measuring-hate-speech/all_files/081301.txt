ive felt the same way in my mid teens but it was due to being in a very religious rural area in alabama for a while i just kinda said to myself that i was ace because i wasnt ready to face the fact that i only liked women somehow i got the courage to be fully open about my gayness im sorry that i have no advice to give you but i do hope youll finally be happy and proud about yourself
