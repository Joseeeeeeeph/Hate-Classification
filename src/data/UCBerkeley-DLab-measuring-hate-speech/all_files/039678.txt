my wife definitely gets that as shes cis and straight so she understandably feels like her right to march as my spouse is questionable for me its mixed in a way it would be cool to be called out because i look like a cis guy you know but im sure most people just assume something queer about us and move along then again im from a country where pride is for everyone so i know im quite easygoing with this
