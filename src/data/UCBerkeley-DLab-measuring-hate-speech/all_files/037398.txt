good grief your gf and my stories are the exact same minus the enby for me been on hrt for 13 months and small changes but i never get gendered female and im all tomboypunk so tons of basketball shorts and band t shirts in my wardrobe and never getting gendered correctly really bothers me but i also dont always want to glam it up just so people can stare and misgender me anyway
