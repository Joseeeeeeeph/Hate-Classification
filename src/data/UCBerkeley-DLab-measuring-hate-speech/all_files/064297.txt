all the invective attacks against the women of this great us football team are disgraceful and inappropriate from the comments i am reading many are misogynistic homophobic discriminatory and anti american their football is great they deserve their accolades and applause       they are much more well known than their male counterparts who collapsed *before* the world cups sweet sixteen rounds the mens game is going backward whilst the women move forever forward i bid them all of the best hurtling other teams going forth on their conquests for more victories
