no i dont think theres an orthodox belief that you need to have jewish ancestry to convert what the belief is that converts are jewish in our past lives but were reincarnated into a non jewish body for numerous reasons most common being living an un jewish life in the last life even though a convert has been born into a non jewish body the converts soul has always been jewish and just needs a proper beit din to affirm the jewish ness of the convert having jewish ancestry has 0 relevance or whatsoever unless if your mother and everyone along her maternal line were jewish
