i think of my younger self i was the happiest little girl as a child and i could never imagine looking that kid in the face and telling her that her life would end in a matter of decades and she could do nothing about it i always keep going for the person in me that wants to live some other details i am transgender ftm which makes it a lot easier for me to disassociate from my younger self and see her as a different person i like to see her as my own child in a way as someone i have to take care of
