being mixed race is hard and i cant imagine how hard as it is as a parent my sisters and i have a english first name and punjabi middle names my brother had a punjabi first name which he loves but it got him picked on a lot you have to deal with people not being able to pronounce or bullying but at the same time you want to be true to you and your culture we plan on naming our children traditional mexican and punjabi names but trying to find ones that flow a little easier or look aesthetically a little easier
