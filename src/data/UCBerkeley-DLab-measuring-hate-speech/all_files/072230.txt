dont worry thats not a reason i know quite a few gay people and imm very supportive of all this and sometimes find manman relationships in a way a lot more human special really the most beautiful human connections ive ever witnessed were probably gay men i dont know its hard to explain but never ever felt attracted to women in my life so its really not about your friends you dont get gay by having gay friends
