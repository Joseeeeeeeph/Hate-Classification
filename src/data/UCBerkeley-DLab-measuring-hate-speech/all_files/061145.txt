from an american citizen absolutely nta you have the autonomy to make your own choices and you can enjoy things about a country without wanting to become a citizen no country is perfect and people who dont tolerate any kind of criticism of america are being ridiculous i for one am glad youre here and hope that you have a community who make you and your family feel welcome and accepted
