i 100 say im lucky to be white passing because it affords me privileges others dont have i recognize this and know it is lucky for me i think these women are lucky to stay home i think moms that work and love it are lucky to work and love it let people thank their universe for their things bruh literally how does it affect you and your things if her gratefulness makes you feel less worthy thats on you
