this so much this i wasnt sure about my sexuality until i was around 18 and even now i still have waverings here and there please dont feel pressured to work it out right away but having said that if you do figure it out young dont feel like thats not valid everyone works it out at there own pace i have friends who new they were bigay since before their teens and equally i have a grandma who didnt come out as lesbian until after she had 5 kids and was a full grown adult
