as a religious person myself pastors heavily encourage inviting friends over to church to try to give them gods guidance and wisdom and stuff i personally dont care wether my friends are religious but if theyre open too it ill tell them about it or invite them i feel like christians sometimes can cross the line on where to stop but yeah
