i hope canada takes no role in the united states border crisis they can handle their own mess we have a legal system that needs to be followed and they are able to seek asylum through routs that are already in place putting thousands of people to the front of the line because its a hot topic right now only undermines our system and is completely unfair to the people seeking refuge from african countries and well as people fleeing war in the middle east we shouldnt be taking economic refugees from latin america when there are people running from genocide elsewhere
