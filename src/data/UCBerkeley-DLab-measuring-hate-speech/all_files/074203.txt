im bi too im older than i should be for this sub but it took me over 6 years to come to terms with my sexuality and finally decide to open up to a select few of my friends right now only 2 of my closest male friends know and about 7 of my close female friends know its a lot easier opening up to girls as a guy they are a lot more understanding of it
