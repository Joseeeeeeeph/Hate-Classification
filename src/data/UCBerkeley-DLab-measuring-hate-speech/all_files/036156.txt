i dont see a problem at all i think im on a similar situation i recognize myself more towards asian culture than the one from my own country i think each ethnicity has its own unique characteristics but i find asians ones more attractive over the others just like i find their culture more interesting its not wrong to love people who has the qualifications that you like i mean its supposed to be just like that you like people who you admire right
