absolutely i used to think women and men were equal in emotional content but boy was i wrong i have seen my mom and sister struggle with emotions but when i saw my own daughter struggle i realised that being a girl and going through puberty is an emotional roller coaster that i could not handle personally great respect for all the women in my life including the transgenders i love you all
