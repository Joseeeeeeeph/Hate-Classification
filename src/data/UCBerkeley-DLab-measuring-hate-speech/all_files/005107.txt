i just see a growing trend with people feeling not trans enough if they dont get the surgery or people hyping it like it isnt a big deal and youll feel so much better afterwardsi dont even have dysphoria anymore i know that there are many ways to transition and that its basically its own spectrum and many people know they never want the surgery but its becoming less acceptable to even have a conversation about it when we cant even talk about it anymore then lots of people are going to slip through the cracks which is happening already
