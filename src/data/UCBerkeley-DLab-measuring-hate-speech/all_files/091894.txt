i like malvika subba too and her advocacy for equal rights esp to lgbtq community in nepal among other things but i totally disagree with u on shrinkhala shes not just some insta girl shes also a engineer who topped pulchowk which is a hard thing to do and she represented our country very well internationally coming to top 12th in miss world which is non small deed alright so for me shes the best
