oh i know thats the point thankfully my girlfriend was fine with my transition but not all trans people are so fortunate and its really not anyones obligation i think the act of asking someone hey if i transitioned would you still love me and expecting them to just say yes is really making light of what transitioning actually is whats involved etc etc and so on
