hey thanks for the response so do you get what im trying to say it shows your sincerity in your faith and thats good however if you declare that you support this faith whatever it says it stands for whatever its done in the past and is currently doing you must be prepared to defend not just what you believe in but whatever the faith believe is in as well after all you like many catholics around the world represent the catholic faith you are catholicism
