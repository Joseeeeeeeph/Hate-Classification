the send her back chant was foul though not illegal or even hateful and not particularly racist as it applies to anyone who plots and schemes to overthrow the nation regardless of melanin content trump left it as her choice the crowds speech required it and lets remember the squad are the authoritarians here people oppose her because she stands against liberty and the core tenets of western society it would have been wise for trump to stop the chant and point this out so he would have had the image of holding the higher moral ground
