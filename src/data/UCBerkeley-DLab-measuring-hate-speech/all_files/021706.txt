i was in the same boat for many many years at 28 i finally decided i couldnt keep it in any longer i came out to my sister first she was the person i trusted most to keep it to herself and the person i knew would be most accepting after i told her and realized the world wouldnt end if someone else knew it became much easier to open up to others about my sexuality it was a gradual process for me and being on the other side of it now i am a much happier healthier person just know that the people who really belong in your life will love you no matter who you love best of luck
