at the best of times some of the stories i hear make me admire these people all the more the difficulty of moving halfway across the world oftentimes to a place with barely any other chinese people having to learn a new language and customs and be away from your extended family its all hard to fathom while ive met plenty that have barely integrated a woman in guyana holding a guyanese passport unable to speak anything but chinese and needing my help talking to authorities the majority that do they make me aspire to be even more adaptable in life
