we still attend i still believe in god and jesus my husband believes in god we think having some sort of religious faith is important we could go somewhere else but this is our history and faith tradition so it makes more sense to stay we teach our children a lot of our own principles and values we dont preach or teach one true church so far its working for us there are definitely things i have to roll my eyes about on occasion we arent openly dropping truth bombs in gospel doctrine we go for the values it teaches take the good and leave anything negative behind
