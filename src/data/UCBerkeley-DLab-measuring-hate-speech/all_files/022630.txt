something to keep in mind is that the ancient jewish writers *intentionally warped* the names of their rivals gods to mock them its like how certain people delight in calling muslims moose limbs does islam have anything to do with the appendages of large deer not at all its just two things sound the same and that is the height of some peoples wit these stories are not anthropological documents these are polemics intended to demean and disparage rival deities its like trying to build an image of obama based on cartoons found on right wing blogs
