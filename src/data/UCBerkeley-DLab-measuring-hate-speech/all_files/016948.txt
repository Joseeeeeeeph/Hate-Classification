thats why i dont like it when high profit companiespeople advertise lgbt in the name of support i personally think it leads to more controversy towards the people and especially trans people i dont want to rain on anyones parade either but its also the reason why im not such a big fan of pride month it puts a magnifying glass over you that can lead to you being put in danger sure im confident that im mtf but i dont need big dollar companies trying to push stereotypes like kylie jenner to the public so they can see me as a hypersexual freak
