im 26 and lesbian when i was 15 and dating a girl for the first time i made a uni and named her trueloveangel for the fact that i really believed i was in love at the time i actually didnt end up with anyone i felt i was in love with but i painted the uni rainbow last year to represent my pride to myself ive never had a reason to share that story before i hope it didnt come off as too random haha
