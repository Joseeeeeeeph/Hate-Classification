yes its fine i also like asians specialy east asians and i have a valid reason for that cause my first love was a chinese guy for the first time in my life i felt truly loved and henceforth ive dated asian guys its true that majority asians perfer europeans but in my experience i think its maybe not that much anyway my point is and i say this with personal experience that asians are the best lovers so yeah your british bf is lucky to have you
