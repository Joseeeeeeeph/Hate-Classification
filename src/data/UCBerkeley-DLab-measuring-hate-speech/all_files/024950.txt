i have a gay relative who im close to both me and my parents have advised her to not tell our christian family because we know the drama that would immediately ensue if she decided to come out id support her 100% but right now shes young dependent on her parents and even if she doesnt deserved to get shamed for it our family definitely would its a shitty situation because our relatives are shitty im not denying that  but acknowledging that reality doesnt make ops mom an ah imo her trying to take it easy on the uncle definitely does though
