nta i might be biased but i believe all children should be raised like that to be raised without religion but let them know its a thing that some people believe in and answer any questions they may have ultimately letting them choose for themselves what to believe in i think hardcore forcing children or people in general that they *must* believe in x religion or else they are damnedbad people is super shitty and just makes your religion look worse dont even get me started on parents who shame punish or disown their children for not having the exact beliefs they have
