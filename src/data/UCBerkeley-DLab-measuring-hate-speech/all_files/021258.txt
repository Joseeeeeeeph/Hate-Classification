you presume a lot about my beliefs if he highlighted some people are forced to wear it i would not cry islamophobia but good attempt at a strawman you also provide no reason why it shouldnt be normalised i dont care so long as people choose to wear it and it would be an invasion of personal liberty to prevent that if it is wrong for people to socially pressure women to wear a burqa or niqab it is wrong to pressure them to wear other things it doesnt harm others so what reason is there for banning it at all
