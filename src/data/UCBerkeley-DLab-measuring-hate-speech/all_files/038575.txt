if someone declares they believe in jesus then they are not a jew  he does not believe in our faith its simple both in israel and across the jewish world there is a blanket rejection of messianic jews they are ineligible to make aliya because it is not accepted that a jew can believe in jesus therefore they are excluded from the law of return as people who have voluntarily converted out of judaism the supreme court ruled the messianic jews belief in jesus makes them christians thus ineligible for citizenship  jerusalem post 12162017
