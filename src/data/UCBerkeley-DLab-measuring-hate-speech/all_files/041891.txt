i thought i was going to have a girl and i did i didnt really care about the gender but i know others who have dealt with gender disappointment my one friend wanted a girl and had a boy she was sad but now cant imagine life without him or with a girl she is oad i now feel a little extra joy when women are pregnant with a boy because i never had a boy i have a nephew that i am close with but its not the same as time moves forward i find gender less and less of a thing i love my child regardless that she is a girl congrats
