where does the policy say dangerous individuals also it looks like the policy has been updated url since this post do you have a web archive from what i remember it listed these groupsurl as people you can call for violence on i think they also included people who were found guilty in court of doing shitty things like epstein like i hope all nazis die in a fire or all isis fighters should be killed or it would be great if epstein was raped in prison i dont see how milo would fall into under any of those classifications
