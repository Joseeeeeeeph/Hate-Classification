i knew i liked girls when i was 11 when i went to girls camp for the first time at 12 i was an extremely happy girl it was seriously the highlight of my summer every year kids know when theyre young who theyre attracted to some come out as bi because its easier than coming out as gay i married a man for the same reason im glad youre accepting just keep letting her know youll love her no matter what thats the most important thing
