im a minority that speaks mandarin but when theres other minorities in the group i always make sure that they get to sing their songs of choice english usually but ive had some nice malay songs sung too its not just about letting them sing its also being supportive when they are singing i mean  if a chinese person in a group of white dudes insisted on singing a mandarin song and while heshe is singing the white people all just sulk in the corner and look bored  who on earth wants to put up with that sort of vibes at ktv
