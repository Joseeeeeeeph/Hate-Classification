while i am not black im indian i also think this is a great message especially for young people of all races in general one reason is that the media has a tendency of glorifying certain celebrities athletes millionaires etc with crazy lifestyles which people from multiple races and cultures are exposed to people aspire to that thinking money could and should be made easily as well as could and should be spent frivolously so thank you valerie for this message which i hope many others besides just people in the black community get to see and hopefully learn from
