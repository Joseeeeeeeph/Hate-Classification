its such a subtle expression of his faith while he such a tremendous display of what it actually means he will mention god but it doesnt seem forced or excessive instead he will show you what it means to follow in the footsteps of jesus through his unceasing love and compassion that is how you spread the word and your faith i may not align with christianity or any religion and i dont think religion is necessary to live a loving life but if religion is what brings people to that kind of life and fulfills them then i can support that
