a casual fan is someone who watches game of thrones doesnt much care for theories hardly knows its based on a book and never really invested themselves proper into the characters in my honest opinion and if your criteria for liking a last season is at least it ended i dont think you actually liked it comparing got to simpsons is a straw man argument if i ever saw one though
