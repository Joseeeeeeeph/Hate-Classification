our local pride was yesterday and i didnt go because of the same stuff its a nice sentiment to say to someone go anyway but the feelings of not belonging or not being seen or accepted the way you hope you will are sometimes pretty strong i didnt want to wear a bunch of bi pride stuff just to prove that i belong there
