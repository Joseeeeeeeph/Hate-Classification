korean churches in the us act like more community centers for koreans not just religious places im not religious at all but ive been to many korean churches as a guest with friends and christianity never came up people just talked about food school family and culture im sure they would be happy to talk to you about secular topics like those but i can understand if you still dont feel comfortable
