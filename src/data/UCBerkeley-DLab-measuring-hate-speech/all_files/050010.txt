man im latino and had married a pakistani i think thats a much wider cultural divide but we were able to bridge it it just takes mutual understanding respect and in some cases standing up to your family if your mother doesnt want to get along with this woman because shes bengali your mother is making a conscious choice you have to love and respect your mother but shes totally wrong with the idea that your cultures are incompatible or something bengalis are also delightful
