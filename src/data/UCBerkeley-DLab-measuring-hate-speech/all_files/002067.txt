thats definitely true my main point was that koreans brought christianity over so it was an organic movement a lot of people make a distinction between christians and catholics ive sat through sermons in protestant churches where the pastor credits foreign missionaries with bringing christianity to korea there is a lot of whitewashing and cover up of the true history even protestants put their own spin on it
