for example the greek orthodox have a chant to god called agios o theos theos was a greek term for the uncreated cause of the universe a little different then the modern day western notion of a personal creator god but similar the chants in orthodoxy the liturgy the prayer to the saints and of course to mary who they called theotokos which is mother of god in greek this is all from greek paganism im not knocking it i love orthodoxy but its just a simple fact id argue that more modern forms of protestantism arent nearly as pagan
