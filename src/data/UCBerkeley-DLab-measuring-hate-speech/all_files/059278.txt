well i think it sucks that we are still not having true equality getting paid less dealing with prejudices and so on apart from that menstruation is not so great on the other hand i really like my boobs a lot im not into girls but i like mine and its nice to wear skirts and dresses especially on hot days i dont envy men who have to wear suit on formal occasions while i am allowed to wear a short dress
