so im bi but i feel this subreddit is still somewhat relevant to me but heres my thoughts i myself wear band tees and other stuff that isnt the usual lgbt associated attire sometimes i do but not often but ive hardly ever had issues out at gay bars or with my gay friends some have asked why but most people dont really care i think but youll always have haters no matter how you dress just do you and dress how you want not for others approval
