my first few lgbt friends outside of college i met when i used to volunteer at the lgbt center here but yeah its tough as fuck in general making new friends when youre older i consider everyone who has a sold group of close friends theyve known for forever incredibly lucky most of my friendships have happened in phases including the lgbt friends
