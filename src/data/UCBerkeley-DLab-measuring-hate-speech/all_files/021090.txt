add another to the minority id say yes cd people can be under the transgender umbrella i say that as people can struggle with their gender and just because were not dressed up it didnt mean the feelings around gender and how it doesnt quite feel right go away id rather have an umbrella term like trans or transgender that can include all of us i think there are so many outside the community who want to push us back into the shadows or drive us apart
