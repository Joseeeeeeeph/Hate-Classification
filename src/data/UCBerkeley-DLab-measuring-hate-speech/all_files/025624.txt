my parents had us attend a presbyterian and a methodist church growing up switched churches when we moved towns in the grand scheme of religion in the usa these are two very mild denominations in fact presbyterians pcusa now allow for openly gaylesbian ordained pastors they still have a long ways to go regarding equality and lgbtq issues but they are moving in the right direction
