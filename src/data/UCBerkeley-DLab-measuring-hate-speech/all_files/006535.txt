i kind of feel a strong dislike for it yet as i stated only when it is refering to me that mightve been strong wording indeed i realize it now s i think you might be right now that i think about it i think i saw coming out as bi as a compromise since my family isnt fully accepting something like oh yeah i like girls but i theres a chance ill end up with a guy rather than just oh yeah i like girls and when ill go steady and marry someone itll probably be a girl not the wisest thing ive done i agree thanks for the reply ill try to do that
