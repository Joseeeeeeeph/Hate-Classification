same here i feel honestly guilty that because i didnt fully accept my sexuality until years after id been with my boyfriend and weve been together so long my rural religious family just assumes im straight so ive never had to come out to them its easy to say its because theyre in another state but i havent even told my coworkersfriends because some are guys and i feel like theyll see me as a novelty like oh it would be hot to see you make out with a woman like thats all it is for us
