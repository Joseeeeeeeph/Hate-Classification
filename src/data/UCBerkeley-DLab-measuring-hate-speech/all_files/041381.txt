just to add on to your post the idea that the usa hates representative democracy for muslims needs to contend with several recent examples of the us establishing or attempting to representative democracy in afghanistan bosnia kosovo and even iraq while you can argue whether iraq was better or worse under saddam or we they are currently an independent democracy which acts in its own interests even when they dont align with the usa such as playing hardball with their oil contracts and only leasing them instead of selling them which the usa wanted them to do
