this is based off of the original chinese story of mulan but there is a huge mistake made in this mulan was from northern china and fought to protect the northern border but in this film her family is seen living in a tulou owned by the hakka which are from the south the people from china saw this as disrespectful and ignorant towards chinese culture claiming that the movie was made to appeal western audiences
