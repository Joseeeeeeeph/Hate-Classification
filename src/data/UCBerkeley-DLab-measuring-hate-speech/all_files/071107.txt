i mean a lot of religions are going to vary by whomever is leading the congregation for jews congregations for example its going to depend for the most part on the rabbi whether you feel like youre accepted it will be much the same for a lot of protestant religions i wouldnt recommend catholicism however just because theyre lead by a lot of tradition and the bureaucracy of the religion makes it hard for individual communities to make changes
