if my partner came out to me as trans i would love snd support them i might even try to stay but i dont know if i could because well a lot of trans people go sort of crazy for a bit given the situation this is actually quite reasonable as theyre trying to relearn about themselves and their bodies theres often a lot of bew hormones and everything plus all the every day life style changes the person who begins that journey is often not the person who finishes it which is fine and again quite understandable
