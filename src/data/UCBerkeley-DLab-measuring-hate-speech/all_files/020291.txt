i cant speak on behalf of trans people but i know that ive never felt uncomfortable with being in my body or with the organs i have meaning my gender and my sex happen to be the same what ive learned is that for trans people it doesnt feel like that some may feel like they are in the wrong body to such a degree that it is causing real suffering i suppose itd be like if everyone in the world started calling me a woman i know im not and ive never felt that way but it would be really hard to explain that feeling to people
