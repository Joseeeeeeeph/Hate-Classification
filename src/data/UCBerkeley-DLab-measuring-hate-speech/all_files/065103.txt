i genuinely dont understand this men complain about women aborting their kids without their consent but they dont want to wear a condom as soon as i was sexually active i made sure to go on the pill so i wouldnt get pregnant i didnt want a baby so i did what i could to avoid having one why dont more men want to use their only available option to avoid getting someone pregnant especially if theyre morally opposed to abortion
