ive always been partial to the oriental orthodox church myself ive found their arguments regarding chalcedon to be more convincing in any case do you consider yourself a universalist in other words are you ok with islamic societies doing the same thing but with islam since they view it as objectively true or would you prefer they accept catholicism i do appreciate you answering these questions i very much disagree with you but i like to read peoples arguments and see their line of reasoning
