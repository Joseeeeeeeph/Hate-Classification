yup agree some liberals take gender roles as offensive but honestly it just makes everything easier lol and of course not all conservative and religious women are happy so why would someone get mad at an article theres always gonna be a percentage thats not and conservatives dont just think oh everythings fine as it is we always want to improve our lives but generally just dont complain or bring oneself down about it quite as much because thats never going to help ones happiness
