well said people are too angry at the term white privilege i feel like its a topic where people obtained a hasty conclusion and just dont care to look deeper into it to understand because they dont want to feel like their issues are being overlooked which theyre not like for me  i will experience hardships due to being a minority hispanic man in america that white people will never but i am also privileged to be a straight cis able bodied male i have my own privileges that others do not its really not a difficult topic to grasp
