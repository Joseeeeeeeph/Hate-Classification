in regards to the last part i fully understand i had a protestant friend and we did some community service in their temple and i was just more exposed to it all i couldnt really say much about that but she could visibly show disinterest or annoyance when i talked about my catholic stuff i feel it was a bit unbalanced and relate to your experience
