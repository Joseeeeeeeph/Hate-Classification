i can see how ahmadis might exclude people from other backgrounds or races but i dont think this is widespread and certainly not indicative of the jamaat as an organization the jamaat tries hard to use the local language of a country in events even if that means everyone is speaking in their second language there are some structural issues and blindspots for sure in the jamaat and how it approaches diversity but i dont think its anywhere near a fundamentally exclusive racist organization
