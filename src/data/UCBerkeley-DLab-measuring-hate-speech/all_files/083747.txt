im sorry this sucks i have often had thoughts in a similar vein even though i dont have anyone nearly as negative in my nuclear family i was depressed for years when i thought i was straight and now that i know im gay it is like i feel so much better and so much worse all at once i feel free in accepting myself but acceptance from the rest of the world is i sense going to be a struggle good luck were all here for you
