my husband is a man and he also is caring and supporting he is also a great listener and loves all of his friends i dont see what gender has to do with it yes it sounds feminine to some people but at the end of the day we are surrounded by a large amount of friends that absolutely love me and my husband for having these qualities you can choose to say thats not how my world works but you can make it that way and enrich everyone around you
