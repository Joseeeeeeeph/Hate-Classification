i know you are being sarcastic but i do on this sub i actively support many causes including many unpopular ones from animal rights gender inequity racism heightismweightism etc i am not from the lgbt community this is just one of the issues i support i voice out strong opinions or cold hard facts that people find it hard to accept emotionally or are too short sighted to see i call upon the catholic community to do what is right here and denounce conversion therapy i will even go so far as to say they must change their belief that homosexual acts are sinful
