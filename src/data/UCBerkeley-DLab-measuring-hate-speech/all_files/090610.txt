damn that really put something words well that ive been thinking of for awhile how i feel like most of the christians i know only care about me being a christian not about who i really am and how i really feel whereas now that im pagan i have friends who are spiritual agnostic atheist and even a few open minded christians who actually accept me for who i am and care about me being myself more than about me following their personal beliefs its like its showed me who really cares about me as a person
