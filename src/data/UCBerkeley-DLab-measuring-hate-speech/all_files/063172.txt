white dude here its not a thing for me personally i have been with white girls black girls asians latinas etc i have always been more partial to girls with darker haireyescomplexion and i have always felt its probably because my sister and i are practically twins so i have never been that attracted to blonde girls though definitely still have been that being said i am currently getting to know a girl who happens to be black and who is quite possibly the most interesting person i have ever met so i really hope it works out
