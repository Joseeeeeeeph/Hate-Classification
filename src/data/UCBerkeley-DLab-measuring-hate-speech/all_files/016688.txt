i think all transgender people dont want to be trans they want to be just maleman or femalewoman hard part is that with changes we directly change sexual interactions partner may expect something from sexual relationships so thats main reason its not good to fully be closed at least with those with whom you considering serious relationships so yes i will never be true woman never will experience menstruation pregnancy its hurt i wish people just accept me with my gender like any other person with traditional gender dont bother dont see it see just me
