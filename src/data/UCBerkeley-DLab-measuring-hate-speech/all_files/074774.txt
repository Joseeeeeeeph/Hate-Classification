i think that one issue is where you live and the level of homophobia there are of course gay men and women everywhere but when it is not safe people conceal my understanding from your previous posts is that there are no lgbt organizations that you are aware of near where you live do i understand that right are there any gay bars or at least gay friendly bars in your city if so drop in have a beer and chat up the bartender come back a few times have conversations get to know a few names and faces it is work to become known
