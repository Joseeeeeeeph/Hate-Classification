i didnt come out until i was 28 and by that time i had been married to a woman for over 4 years she wasnt impressed but for me it was and the single greatest thing i had done for myself i got my own place and have really enjoyed the journey my life has taken since then and i am at the very start of a new relationship with a guy that is completely different from my other past relationships and i am really looking forward to where that might take us
