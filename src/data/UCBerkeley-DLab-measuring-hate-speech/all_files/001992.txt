awww man dont let it affect you like that if people stare at you just stay close your head up and smile like a princess theyll probably go ughhh and it just means theyre envious and mean dont let meanies stop you from being with who you want to be with i think interracial couples are cute and ive been seeing a lot of them recently i even saw a cute elderly couple talking about dinner as they were walking out of walmart if people have the nerve to be mean at you rather than be happy then that means they have no love to give because of their own miserable lives
