dont get me wrong i enjoy the company of men very much i just want to be able to take advantage of my bisexuality and have sex with both men and women and it frustrates me that i cant i believe i would be equally as frustrated if it were the other way around where i would have success with women but none with men my frustration isnt that i end up sleeping with men necessarily but that im not successful with women and the only options i can think of is to pay for it but im too broke for that
