ive decided im not going to come out as bi to my family and friends my entire life my family made it clearly they didnt want me to have any relationships with men and its even worse because i actually get along really well with them both i love them with all my heart and i know they love me as bizarre as that may sound i know there are so many people out suffering from way worse than myself but i still felt like if i came out things would change and everyone would see me differently and i dont need that in my life
