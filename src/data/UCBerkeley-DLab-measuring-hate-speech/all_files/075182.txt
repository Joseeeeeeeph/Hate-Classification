you make a lot of good pointsin the west being indian isnt considered a cool thing thus i fear unless kids from mixed marriages are taught the pros of being indian and are immersed in indian culture more than likely they will try to gravitate towards white culture however they will not look white and that will hurt their own self esteem one thing i love about punjabis is that we are so big into being punjabi thus punjabi kids are generally more sure of themselves
