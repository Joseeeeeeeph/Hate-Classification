i am not muslim but i knew these things i just didnt feel comfortable for speaking for a religion that isnt my own thank you for putting this out there i get it can be confusing but it shouldnt be we are a christian nation with 1000s of christian denominations that all interpret in their own way what being christian means so its not such a foreign concept
