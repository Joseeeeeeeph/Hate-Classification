i went to the slc pride parade for the first time i took a few of my kids and we went with my gay sibling and met up with a gay cousin and partner it was pretty cool i dont think ive ever been in a setting like that where there was such a high level of acceptance no one is judging anyone else all are accepted honestly it was much more enlightening and satisfying than any church meeting i went to in 40 years of active membership
