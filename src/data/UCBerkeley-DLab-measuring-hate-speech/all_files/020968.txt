im 41 a few years ago it started to dawn on me that 1 i might be hating sexism and gender roles not only bc i was a woman im afab but also because i was *not* a woman and 2 that ive never really had a feeling of my own gender inside me just things about how i choose to present myself or how people react to me i currently identify as an agender woman within the umbrella of nonbinary my partner and some of my friends know but not all of them and not my coworkers or clients i still pass as a cis woman on most days so i treat that as my uniform at work and i get by
