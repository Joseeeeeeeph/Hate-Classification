before i joined the church i had absolutely no problem with them and wanted to them to have marriage equality and everything now im not really sure what my stance is to be honest im still trying to align my personal beliefs with the churchs beliefs i mostly feel the same about lgbt as i did before i joined the church but realise my church beliefs dont match up with that i try to recognise that i dont know or understand everything about the world or the church and just trust in my testimony of the church
