thank you for sharing this i just recently accepted that im demisexual after years of feeling like something is wrong with me because im not sexually attracted to someone after a first second or even a fifth date i cant tell you how many times ive just gotten myself drunk to have sex with a guy in order to feel normal its really nice to hear fro people with similar experiences
