im glad your own experiences have made for a better life for yourself and its great that youve been accepted as everyone of the lgbtq community should be i do believe its a disorder also but im not saying that in a derogatory way the question i ask really stems from the fact that id like to see how better we can help people live with said disorder and be happy in that disorder because i dont think telling trans people that what they are going through is normal is going to solve that
