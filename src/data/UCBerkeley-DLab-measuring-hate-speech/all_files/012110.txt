part of the stigma in society is that black women are often seen as much stronger than regular women i suppose everybody who didnt jump up is part of the problem and people would like to say yeah they would jump up if they were there but clearly shows peoples reactions when they see a black woman getting beat there is no savior for the black woman and some of us have no choice but to live up to the stigma just to protect themselves
