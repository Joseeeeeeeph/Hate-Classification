this is pretty awesome seeing how they interact and all great vid it was rly interesting all of the lgbtq talk people have been hurt by the church before and as a christian i can say its sick to know people are treated less than they should be just because their sin may be more noticeable but we all sin were all broken it still doesnt change the problem with the sin but it means that people rly need to take a heart check we all fall short so stand your ground pray for discernment with acceptance
