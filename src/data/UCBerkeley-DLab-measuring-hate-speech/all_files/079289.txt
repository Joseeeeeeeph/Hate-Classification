seriously what a refreshing viewpoint i think part of it has to do with how long people have been transitioning too and i do totally understand sometimes i feel irked if i dont get catcalled or feel pride if i do but immediately after im disgusted and fearful ive heard similar things from a lot of cis women but we were raised to think that complements to our beauty were of the utmost importance and it doesnt validate me in any way lol if anything its more the disgust and fear that really makes me feel like im a woman
