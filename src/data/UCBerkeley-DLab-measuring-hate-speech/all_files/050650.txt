i see that the white nationalist shooter was captured alive and well so let me just see if im properly understanding this nice little set up that has been established in the us *be black and suspected of selling single cigarettes  death by chokehold*   *be white indoctrinated by far right extremist rhetoric and conduct a mass shooting that leaves 20 people dead  wind up in custody* am i missing something here
