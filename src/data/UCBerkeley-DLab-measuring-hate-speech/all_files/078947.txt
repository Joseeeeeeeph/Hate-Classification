i completely relate to you for me i was in denial because i always thought that id be down with being a guy but id prefer to be a girl but as time went on i realized that the preference wasnt preference it was a necessity for me even though im okay with being a guy id be really sad now thats dysphoria in many aspects but that alone being a preference is pretty much dysphoria in itself it may not be as big as other forms but preferring in my eyes is dysphoric in a way does that make sense
