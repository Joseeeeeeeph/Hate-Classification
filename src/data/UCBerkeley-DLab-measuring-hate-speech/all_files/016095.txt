i was gonna say this lol but it seems to be regional dependent from what i can tell in regards to the states i mean like im from the south and an open relationship is still a very rare thing to come across but over the west coast theyrs downright proud of how theyve redefined the meaning of relationship gay men especially i took a trip to san fran last october and i cant tell you how many times i heard that weve redefined it line dropped in bars as soon as a guy realized i was southern haha
