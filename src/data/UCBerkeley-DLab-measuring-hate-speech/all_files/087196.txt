besides companies trying to keep on top of diversity isnt necessarily a bad thing in my eyes non whites women and sexual minorities are underrepresented in just about every industry in the first world and not by coincidence hiring biases exist and due to lack of opportunities its tougher to break in for those with biases against them plus different backgrounds add different experience and ideas to the company so its healthy for them too forced representation still isnt the solution there should be equality of opportunity not of outcome
