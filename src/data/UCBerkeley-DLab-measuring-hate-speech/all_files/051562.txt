im blessed that both my mom and very yes mil accept that we dont want kids but why other people think its appropriate to ask and then question our decision to not have children is beyond me before i met my husband peoplewomen would try to convince me that i would change my mind when i met the right man like my uterus would suddenly come alive because i found the right penis men never ask these questions why do women think its ok to pressure other women about this
