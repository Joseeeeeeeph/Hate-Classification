my problem is that you said that the us isnt killing gay people they are killing migrants though but i guess were not talking about migrants so it doesnt matter and my real big problem is youre using you have having healthcare as an excuse to not really care whats happening or not give a shit as you put it the healthcare itself isnt a problem
