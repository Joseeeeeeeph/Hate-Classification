my wife did rcia and i was her sponsor i was a bit disappointed in the rcia program in terms of how it barely touched the surface of catholicism meanwhile most of the candidates were really thirsty to get into more depth i think it was a huge missed opportunity so i would like to let you know to plan on pursuing your curiosity and search for truth without relying on rcia to bring this to you finally welcome to the catholic church its a rich seemingly complex thing that you are embracing
