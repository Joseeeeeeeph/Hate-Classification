just what i wanna see a small minded racist who couldnt pass a citizenship test if it was presented to him flaunting his hatred of america while believing everything progressive is bad probably triggered by hatred of the gays during the bush era and now fully echo chambered into existing in a fox news bubble so tight that he can only post negative comments on youtube videos from msnbc rather than actually paying attention to what they are saying maybe msnbc should put up trigger warnings for snowflakes like him
