majority of my best friends have been straight guys we can gush about girls together share similar interests and hobbies and overall theres no worry about being attracted to them on my end at least lol whereas with girl friends ill usually end up crushing on them at first or maybe for a while which i think changes the way i act around them slightly anywho ya i like having straight guy friends glad you found a good one too
