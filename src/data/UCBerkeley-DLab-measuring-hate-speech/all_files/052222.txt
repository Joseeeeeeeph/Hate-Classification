honestly there are a lot of different hindu traditions depending on region some have folk gods or spirits mixed in some have one god but believe in the others some only believe in one god its really cool especially since its mixed and effected other religions in the area like islam sikh christianity and buddhism i feel like hinduism and ifs studies are ignored despite being the biggest more influential and most interesting the only problem for me is i speak english only so i cant keep up with the names a lot
