im sorry to hear that man honestly as a canadian this shit just sounds so unreal to me like i cant image women being denied any medical procedure here let alone a routine one same with lgbtq people losing rights the pride parade literally banned cops from last years event lol its easy to generalize all americans together but sometimes i forget that the majority of people in that country are suffering this post really opened my eyes to that i feel for you brother really hope you find peace and remember the north is always welcoming
