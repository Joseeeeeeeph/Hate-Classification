here in utah we have pioneer day on july 24th to celebrate when the mormon settlers arrived in the salt lake valley people like to put up american flags to celebrate as this is essentially a 2nd fourth of july here i read something this year for the first time pointing out that when the white settlers first got here putting aside native americans and all that it was still mexico and thats part of why they were coming here mormon pioneers fled the united states to seek refuge in parts of mexico how do we celebrate that with american flags were not the brightest bunch sometimes
