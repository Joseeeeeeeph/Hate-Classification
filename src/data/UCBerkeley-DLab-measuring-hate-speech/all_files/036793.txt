im not talking about whether the person got srs or not im talking about whether the discourse around the discussion is credible srs in thailand requires at least 2 letters from qualified mental health professional and im pretty sure most clinics enforce a 18 policy i think its reasonable to wait until 18 at least but how people choose to treat the children under the guidance of medical professionals is none of my business
