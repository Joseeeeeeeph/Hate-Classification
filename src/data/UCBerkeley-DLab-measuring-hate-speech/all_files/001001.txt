yeah ok then what europe and america will be the only two places on the face of the planet that have any k8nf of population and then all the places that all those people fleed from will just soon die out of existence because there is no people to rule over no one to keep those economies going because the people have fled and those countries wont be getting aid money because they wont need it and the us doesnt aid the enemy and doesnt aid when there ate no civilians to aid so yeaheven in theory your plan doesnt sound right
