the sower it all depends how you preach the word there was a man called ge√±ito and he would preach the word but with a harsh way directing himself to the non converted or catholics my mother is a bishop of a protestant church and she preaches with open arms not with pointing fingers btw shes an old soul but with an open mind that attracts people and teaches the old ways without judging oeople no matter even if theyre part of the lgbt community
