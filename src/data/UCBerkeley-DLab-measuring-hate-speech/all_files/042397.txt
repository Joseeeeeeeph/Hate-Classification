how hardcore and somewhat hateful the old testament no one usually actually really reads the bible no one really knows what theyre talking about they are no 100 truth in it all the majority of religions are really restrictive and dont make a lot of sense all the christians and catholic people in my area and super toxic to each other and other religious people theyll slap and jump you if you dont believe in what they do and curse you out they also fight other churches like some holy gang war
