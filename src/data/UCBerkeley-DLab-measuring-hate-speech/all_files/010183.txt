id have created another reddit account or something before posting this and not using chad anywhere people ignore how fucking sick this is and just focus on lol fucking incel stfu instead i honestly dont get why so few women are able to call out the shittiness of other women and always try to instead turn it on whoever is calling out the shitty behavior this seems far less common with men not that it doesnt happen of course
