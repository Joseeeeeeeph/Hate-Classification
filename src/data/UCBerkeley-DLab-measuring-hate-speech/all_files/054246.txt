interestingly while the romans were super racist it wasnt our idea of racism today it was an us or them mentality if you opposed them they would burn your cities and enslave you without a hint of sympathy but if you surrendered immediately when they came for you you were roman it didnt matter your skin color or where you were born you were a roman citizen romans understood where you came from didnt matter it was all about who you were now note i do not support the romans there were barbaric in practice
