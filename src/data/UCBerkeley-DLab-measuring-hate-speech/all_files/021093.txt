eh i care about representation because i think to me it means that people have opportunity but yeah for whatever reason things like cultural appropriation dont really bother me though to see a white person in brownblackyellow face would piss me off but i understand why it bothers other people anyway im not by nature an activist but im happy there are people out there doing the hard work of moving the world forward even if they take a mis step now and then
