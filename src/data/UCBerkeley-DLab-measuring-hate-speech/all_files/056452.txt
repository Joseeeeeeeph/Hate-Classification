i found out late last year that my grandma and great grandma were jewish but i was raised baptist im exploring judaism now but im nervous about talking to a rabbi and am equally as afraid that i wont be accepted hope this doesnt sound bizarre but i feel a certain calling to judaism but i dont know why yet
