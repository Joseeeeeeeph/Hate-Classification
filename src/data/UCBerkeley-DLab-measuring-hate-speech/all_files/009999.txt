iran will start talking or eat nuke fuel for breakfast we dont need another unstable and militant revolutionary state playing in the nuke fuel cycle why start a middle east cold war style nuke arms race if the world tolerates iran staying in the nuke fuel cycle game the horrible deal the us walked away from it will be just a matter of time before other states in the region do the same in order to deter iran weapons of any type are a bad idea in the middle east there are too many fundamentalist religious disputes for a region of nuke martyrs
