i think i know what you mean im also an afab nonbinary person i see myself as a feminine boy i feel like i should have been born with male anatomy but im also pretty girly that being said i want to be read as male so im taking testosterone and getting top surgery soon my ultimate goal is to be able to wear a dress and for people to still see me as a guy also its ok to want to keep your chest the way it is if you wanna do some sort of partial transition thats valid you just need to think about what would make you feel the most comfortable
