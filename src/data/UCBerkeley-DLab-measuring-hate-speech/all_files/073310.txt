the news said it was spread by a white pastor he infected 7 people on a bus and those seven people spread it to others it makes me wonder was this done to exterminate or decrease the population of africans something to think about do we remember when the white doctor in africa caught it and they allow him and others who caught the disease to travel back to america for treatment hmmmm
