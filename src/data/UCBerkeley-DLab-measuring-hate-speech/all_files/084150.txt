i can totally relate to this i spent some weeks backpacking in europe and the best part was all the people i got to meet and hang out with the topic of being gay came out organically with a few of them but over all it wasnt relevant most of the time which was a break from it being so back home like others who have commented here i live in a conservative country and i feel it gets in the way of most guys trusting and opening up to me it would be nice to meet guys at home like the ones i met while traveling but its been rare
