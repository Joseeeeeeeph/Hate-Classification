damn i loved both of them so much and i forgive him along time ago for being a huge fan of his and then hearing the racist remarks im only bringing his up because i see so many comments from people my community talking about him being racist but this has nothing at all to do with being racist and everything to do with losing his spouse and best friend who had nothing to do with what he said and he has helped way more people of all races than he has hurt my prayers go out to him and his family and i truly love and miss his wife and always will
