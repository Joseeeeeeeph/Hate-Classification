im treated like a king in the philippines i completely understand whats at play financially between a foreigner and a philipino its not uncommon to visit homes in the philippines that are built from bamboo and dont have electricity or running water a philipino will treat you right as you are her ticket out of poverty after visiting the philippines i no longer believe that there is any poor people in the us i would never think about bringing a woman to the us on a k1 visa so the biggest drawback is living in the philippines as a foreigner you are isolated and never part of the culture
