i had long had issues with pentecostal doctrines and had left quite a few years before i became orthodox it wasnt history that brought me to become orthodox though things did click when i read about it it was the eucharist i had experienced the presence of god while communion was going on in an orthodox parish i was visiting i had never experienced anything even remotely like it before i immediately knew i had to convert
