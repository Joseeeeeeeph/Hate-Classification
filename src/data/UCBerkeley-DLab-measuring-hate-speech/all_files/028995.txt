i dont see why somehow someone born here is less of a risk or something i remember a case of a kid who shot an intruder who was trying to kill his mom or something ex partner obsessed with the mom kid used his siblings gun kid was undocumented sibling wasnt it was a clean shooting he got deported because it came out that he was undocumented during the proceedings but the courts made no distinction between his right to live and defend himself vs that of a citizen
