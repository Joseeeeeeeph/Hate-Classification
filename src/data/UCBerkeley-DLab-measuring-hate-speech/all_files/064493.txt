agreed i think there are a fair few in denial and to some degree i cant blame them because it cam be emotionally draining being aware of it i can honestly say i never thought black americans were assumed to be less american mainly because of the pervasiveness of african american culture and its appropriation so that is interesting to hear and im curious about how that presents itself and if there are any similarities to the british experience
