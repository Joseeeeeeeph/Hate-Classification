i totally agree with u on that and i notice the same exact thing with bf all my experiences with bf who have a multiracial group of friends have been good literally it is the ones who hang around large groups of bm that most people would find hard to be around with they are the very same that would gladly watch wmaf couples get jumped and killed on spot by other bm and bf not saying thats a good thing
