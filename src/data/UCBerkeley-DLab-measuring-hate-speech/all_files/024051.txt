it is a personal choice it *has* to be we are so thoroughly mixed together in america that no one really knows what mix of races they are for example my wife is of predominantly irish ancestry she chooses white on her forms but i however am different i had an irish grandmother and a libyan grandfather on one side on the other side an english grandfather and a native american grandmother if you were me what race would you choose to identify yourself on your forms and documents
