this is fucking groundbreaking for representation today the only quip i have is that its kinda implying that non binary people are women too like the point of they series pronouns is to not be identified as male or female but also thats a really difficult line if you grew up being gendered as a woman then you still had to put up with the struggles of being a woman in society
