i am a cis man who is happily married to a cis woman and we have kids together i couldnt look more straight if i tried i didnt come to recognize and accept being bi until i was in my forties and married with kids but i proudly identify as bi because i know that i am attracted to women in everyway and i am attracted to other men physically and sexually i also know that if presented with the right person and situation i would be with another man providing that it wouldnt risk losing my wonderful wife and marriage i hope this helps you to accept yourself for who you are
