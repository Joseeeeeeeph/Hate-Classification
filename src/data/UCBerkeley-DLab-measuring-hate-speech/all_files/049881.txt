i am a trans man who doesnt feel dysphoric at the thought of giving birth either and i am not super young so thats the reason why i havent gotten on t yet im afraid of taking that possibility away from myself ive always known i was nb but i realized i was trans only about a year ago i was raised by my father and my mother is non binary and very masculine so i never associated giving birth and raising a child with femininity so yeah im here to say that youre valid and you should go for it if this is what you want
