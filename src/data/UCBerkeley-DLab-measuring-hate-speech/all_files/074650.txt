ive noticed hot topic and spensers always carries lgbtqia pride items warms my heart my boyfriend is a straight cis male and has taken so many steps to educate himself on sexuality after learning about my bisexuality i only hope my country usa will take similar steps not hopeful until a new president is elected however im just lucky i live in a progressive state where loving whoever you choose is praised i hurt for our community who has to hide their love due to outdated laws and stigma you wear that shirt with pride you look amazing in it
