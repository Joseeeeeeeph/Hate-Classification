as a 56 18 year old what i can say to fellow short men is to bodybuild and mind build its mostly all in the mind if your confidence and self esteem is sky high you can get any girl most of the girls i deal with are taller than me or my height and i feel so dominant the fact that im so masculine that i can still make a girl who is taller than me feel feminine
