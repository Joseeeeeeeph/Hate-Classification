im not exactly gay so im not sure if this counts but im telling something one of my gay friends hateone of their pet peeves its whenever a christian tells him that he is unholy or sinful for liking the same gender or when a christian *criticizes* him saying the lord does not approve of this it also pisses me off that he has to deal with this at times
