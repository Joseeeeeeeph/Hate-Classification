this post really hit home for me mom converted to marry my father to please my dads conservative jewish family parents divorced grew up as the only jewish kid in school and then driving an hour to see my father and be surrounded by other jews but still not jewish enough in the eyes of my peers even now as a young person i constantly feel like im not jewish enough because i didnt have the experiences that a lot of my jewish peers have had its hard because i constantly feel the need for validation from my own people
