and its worth mentioning that while male homosexuality was celebrated in greece and rome homosexual relations between females were shunned to say the least the ancients despite popular belief had plenty of sexual hangups they just werent the same as ours today i dont knowhypocritical religious patriarchs who condemn homosexuality in others while practicing it themselves and seek to keep women cloistered and virginal is sounding awfully familiar
