its ok to be supportive of ur lgbt friends and family just try and remember its about them not u also maybe learn some of our history if u havent the first pride was a riot our ancestors fought so hard to earn us the rights we have today and in other places of the world people arent so lucky i think its really just about being respectful its not just a party it means so many things to so many different people
