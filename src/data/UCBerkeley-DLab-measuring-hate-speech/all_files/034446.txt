i feel like an imposter sometimes i feel so strongly that im trans and so happy presenting masculine but i feel like i shouldnt be i can be feminine in nature sometimes but i feel like a feminine guy when i do but no one will take me seriously if i dont like hair on my body or dont want to know about cars or sports or other manly things sometimes it makes me think im just a masculine girl but then i also hate my chest so much that i used to hope for breast cancer
