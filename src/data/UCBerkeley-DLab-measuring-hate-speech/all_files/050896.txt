people attend church for all sorts of reasons social not being the least amongst them id consider finding value in a community of good people who care about each other and try to incorporate decent values id be honest with anyone who i felt genuinely cared about me but i dont believe theres an obligation to fit some belief mold in order to find value in a shared cultural community
