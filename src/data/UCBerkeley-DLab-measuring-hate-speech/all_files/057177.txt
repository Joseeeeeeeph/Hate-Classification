thats true i think as a white american talking about the white american community theres this expectation to have a healthy glow but no more or less too pale and youre a socially awkward shut in and too dark regardless of how you got the tan youre either trashy unhealthy or trying to look like another race obviously both of these are extreme and not everyone thinks this way but it does come up from time to time personally i think whatever you feel your best skin is as long as youre achieving it in a healthy way thats what you should strive for
