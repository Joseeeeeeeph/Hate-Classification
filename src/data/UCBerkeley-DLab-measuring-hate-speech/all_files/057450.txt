ak 74 what i am arguing about is that people who are against homosexuality can have a case and people who are not against it can have their own case if there is no objective morality then people cannot push their own subjective morals into others just like what society is doing right now with homosexuality incest abortion and etc there are some sets of morals people have in common which we should be following but when issues like lgbtq comes in place and there is a big divide the one side cant push their subjective ones into the other
