i dont really care what the motivation is for someone to shoot me i just dont want to get shot if you feel im a bootlicking racist i dont know what to tell you gang activity is mainly a result of economics not race i dont actually recall even mentioning race at all if i did it was wrong and i apologize i think we should try to end all mass shootings not just ones committed by trump fanboys im not sure whats accomplished by ignoring certain crimes based on the motivation or the victim
