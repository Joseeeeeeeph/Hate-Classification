youre right i personally wouldnt consider any denominations or churches as christian if they promote homosexuality or anything else that is considered sinful some other examples that came to mind not to say any are worse than others since god considers all sin to be equally bad idols adultery premarital sex turning to oneself or worldly things to meet our needs instead of jesus these are just some that came to mind any church that promotes these is not christian it may be *based* on christianity but severely straying from the fundamentals
