i use the term queer community because i identify as queer myself because i haaaate the acronym and even though gay can be used as an umbrella term i dont want to risk misunderstandings however ive never heard of gsrm before and i **love** that thank you so much for mentioning it and introducing it to me im definitely going to start using that probably in addition to queer community
