1 yes i think its great for children to be proud of their parents but maybe not pride in sexuality of any kind until their sexuality becomes less dormant 2 i think this is a pride question but im having trouble understanding the relevancy 3 its not that they dont fully understand pride its that they dont fully understand sexuality i dont want kids near sexuality of any kind no offense but i made that obvious in my original post
