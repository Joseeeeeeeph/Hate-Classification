i agree with you it sounds like he doesnt really enjoy the games much even if he says its a favorite for him the way he plays makes it obvious its not the style he likes best which is okay dont get me wrong but dont call it an issue with a game when its just a mechanic you dont enjoy its not wrong its just not your thing
