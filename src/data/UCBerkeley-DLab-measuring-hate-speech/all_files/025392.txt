id honestly have a tiny bit of time for you shitty people if you this was about anything but controlling womenbut its not at best you are pro birth you *actively* work against healthcare for new mums and you rather see a woman try to mutilate herself or locked up just because you have this bizarre belief that a foetus under 18 weeks is some kind of sentient fully aware human its a shame you werent just a miscarriage the world would be a better place for it
