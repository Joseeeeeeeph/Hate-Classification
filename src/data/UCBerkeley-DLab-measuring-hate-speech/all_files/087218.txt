at 17 i was in the closet at 17 my best friend was killed by a drunk driver and i remember thinking that his death was my last chance at being straight because he was the only guy friend i had in my entire life that i didnt have a crush on as i have gotten older i have chilled out its now rarer to see a guy i think is cute than to see a guy i have no interest in
