even if youre spiritually somewhat signed off i encourage you to look for a church that focuses on service not just to their congregation but to the community i was in the same boat a few years back but found a place in an assembly thats truly devoted to making their town a better place for everyone there not just the folks who come on sundays theyre out there but theyre not necessarily easy to find i say this with the caveat that they shouldnt have any tenets that are at odds with the faith of course
