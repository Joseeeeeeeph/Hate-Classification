i would agree that its about sharing culture i specifically go to a clinic for gay people run by gay nurses doctors and other staff makes talking about my personal health so much easier because im around people that understand and know information that straight doctors might not know about simply because they dont live as a gay person and the doctors really care because they are directly influencing and affecting their community
