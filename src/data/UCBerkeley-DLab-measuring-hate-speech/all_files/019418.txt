i loved this story and movie and in particular this quote i have heard multiple women say they want their kids to look like them so no interracial babymaking and it just boggles my mind i look just like my mom and she could care less i even existed it takes more to be a mom than give birth and i truly am humbled by people who choose to adopt they want to be parents and thats pretty much all it takes to be a mom or dad
