when i married my husband i was like yep team heterosexual now it took me a couple of years into my marriage to realise im still a part of the lgbt community everyone here has also helped remind me i am perfectly valid i am still not comfortable with coming out to coworkers and new people but im slowly getting better with owning this part of my identity and one day hope to be more vocal about it without having to feel like defending my sexual and dating history
