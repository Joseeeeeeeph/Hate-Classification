thank you i agree i think the idea of wanting to give exposure to a black business owner and build bridges between cultures is great but i dont think she needed to be the one getting her hair done in order to do that i think just appreciating from a distance and using her platform to help a black woman have her voice and experiences be heard would have been amazing which is what she easily could have done if she just interviewed eden and had her do a black customers hair or something
