americans declared war on and killed indians in large numbers that didnt happen in canada i know im talking to a complete moron so i dont know why im bothering with a history lesson theres 800k black people in canada according to the figures i saw online the tiny amount of black people here in canada dont attach police and they dont join gangs and shoot each other also people dont really live in ethnic ghettos here either so i dont think there really is a black neighbourhood that i can think of off hand
