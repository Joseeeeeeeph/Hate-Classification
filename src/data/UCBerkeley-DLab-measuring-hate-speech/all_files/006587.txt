i relate to this a lot its very similar to the biphobia i experience occasionally in gay and straight communities because in a way demisexuals can be allo passing when in a relationship read can experience sexual attraction some full ace people see that as not truly the same struggle or truly knowing what its like to be full ace its hard to find community and acceptance in the middle of the spectrum id say for the most part the ace community is pretty inclusive but this does happen sometimes im so sorry youre experiencing that in the community you tried to find at school
