stupid coach ravi shastri shame on his tactic to purposely lose against englandthat match made the whole difference except for dhoni and bumrah kick out all the other indian players idiot kohli should be dropped from indian team for atleast a year so that he becomes humble enough and learns a big lesson i agree with sanjay manjrekar thoughjadeja is bits and pieces cricketer he will perform well only once every 10 15 games
