since this topic is brought up we need a thread on whether we believe the median income of black americans has increaseddecreased during the obama and trump eras the article claims that median income has increased but the source looks a little weird i do know for a fact that home ownership for black americans has been decreasing since 2004 and is now at an all time low url this is something not addressed in the obama or trump presidencies
