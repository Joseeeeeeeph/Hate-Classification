a running joke i like to tell people is that the people who receive the help set up a fake house that they let the christians work on so that they get their feel goods the christians most likely have zero fucking experience building infrastructure or whatever the fuck so they take the pic and hang out with the brown kids because oh wow they love me so much i feel so blessed to know these brown kids who love jesus so much even though they have nothing when the batch of christians leave the locals tear it down for the cycle to repeat again with a different set of missionary dweebs
