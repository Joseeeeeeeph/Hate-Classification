i mean if you were an anime studio and you had the opportunity for a live action remake would you want some japanese actor or s big name actor like scarlet johansson lets be honest 75 of the reason people watched it was because of her she brings attention to her movies if she was replaced by some no name white actor maybe you have a point but come on its about the movie wanting to be successful why wouldnt you choose scarlet to play your role
