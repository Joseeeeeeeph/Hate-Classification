i bet that guy googled mass shooters who arent white to make this image it doesnt really matter what color they are anyway how about the fantasy of living in a country without any dumbass shooters the reason people feel the need to point out the majority of recent white male shooters is to highlight that this fear of people with colored skin is pointless everyone can be equally just as fucked and spreading fear of violent illegal immigrants black supremacists and muslim terrorists only acts to actually create these made up monsters in the first place
