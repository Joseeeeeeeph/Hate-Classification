acceptance of others decisions to be who they are i know that it is not the same at all schools but the kids now seem to be way less phased about race or lgbtqia than in the past im not saying there arent issues but it doesnt seem to be much of a thing most of the information around this that goes out is more geared towards making the parents comfortable they also seem to be less religious and if they are a general spiritual belief rather than organized religious more accepting of others beliefs or lack thereof
