thanks for your response you have a good point that my own question could be equally applied to cis gendered as a male myself i hate many aspects of the male gender role but i still want to be male and see myself as such finding how your identity fits in with the rest of society is hard enough for cis gendered i respect all the struggles trans people have with that
