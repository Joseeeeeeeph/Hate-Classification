one of my friends is in a relationship like this and it drives me nuts when she posts pictures of her and her wife who is a trans butch lesbianhoney thats a straight man and youre bi so maybe dont call yourselves lesbians everything she does is or has to be gay and i dont have it in me yeti may yet snap well see lol to call her out on it being gay isnt a personality trait especially when youre not exclusively same sex attracted and being the most woke isnt necessarily the best thing sorry i have no one to vent this shit to lol
