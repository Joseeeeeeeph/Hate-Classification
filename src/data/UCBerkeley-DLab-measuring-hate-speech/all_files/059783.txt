as has already been mentioned sephardic judaism is orthodox by default sephardic synagogues with *maybe* a handful of exceptions all operate according to traditional jewish law and non onbservant sephardim typically do things the orthodox way when they do them with that in mind an orthodox conversion is the only one that would be universally accepted the sole exception is the syrian community which does not accept converts
