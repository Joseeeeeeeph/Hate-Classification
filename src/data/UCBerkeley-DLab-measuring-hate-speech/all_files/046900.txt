yeah i got dragged into going to the sunday session to help babysit my cousins that turned out to be more of a tactic by my mother and uncle to get me to attend it was interesting having been out for nearly 2 years to go back and see everyone lots of love bombing and awkward hugs if most of the people who love me knew i was gay andor what i think about the organization they would probably have had some very different reactions to my presence
