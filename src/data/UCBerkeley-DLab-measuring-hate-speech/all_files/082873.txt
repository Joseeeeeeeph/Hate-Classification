wearing a dress doesnt make you a girl youre right nobody said it did i agree if a male wants to wear a dress be my guest i honestly dont care but if that same male gets offended when someone calls him a male then thats silly well yeah a man can wear a dress and still be male i think you missed my point if you knew nothing of human society and only understood their biology you wouldnt be able to tell if a person with xy chromosomes wore dresses or not because gender has existed long before chromosomes were discovered and ultimately isnt determined by them
