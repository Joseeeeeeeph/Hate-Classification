fellow straight here sex is not a single sex is not immoral if your in a good relationship with someone you love who loves you back then thats what matters there isnt anything wrong with it it doesnr matter if your relationship is homosexual or heterosexual or some other label so long as its consenting loving and between adults dont let some preacher with a bronze age mindset try to get in the way of that fuck his opinion
