im bi and currently dating a woman but was married to a man for a while and everything you said is true another major draw is children adoption is great and i knew i was bi from about age 15 on but i always wanted to start a family now i did conceive my children on accident very early in to my relationship with their father and my eventual husband in my early 20s but at that time i was definitely looking to start a family and i think that was the biggest reason i was mostly pursuing long term relationships with men
