dont know why youre getting downvoted for this im white and i recognize this is a huge component of white privilege we just dont have to think about anyall the issues that people of color face on a daily basis so yeah we dont think about black people or what they go through or what would improve their livesâ€”certainly not to the extent we think about how to do this for ourselves and then we pretend were working for society at large when really that society is designed for white people in mind
