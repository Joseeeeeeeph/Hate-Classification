hey guys you are younger me well kinda theres no exact science to the queer spectrum lets just say at 30 i really seriously looked at my non conforming side coming out would have destroyed my marriage and social network im not satisfied with erotic fantasies any longer as i explore their root i realize id be maybe not happy but id be more comfortable in my skin pick your moment dont feel pressured you can have a closeted life if you prefer i would definitely stop short of marrying someone if you know then you should tell them even if you love them that wont be enough
