honestly ive never really stopped questioning my sexuality and constantly go back and forth between gay and acearo ive just started thinking welp if i like someone i like them if i dont i dont and just identify as gay because thats whats easy comfortable for me labels are just there to help you feel comfortable with yourself and find other people who are like you but if you cant settle on one thats perfectly fine just take it one day at a time my guy no stress
