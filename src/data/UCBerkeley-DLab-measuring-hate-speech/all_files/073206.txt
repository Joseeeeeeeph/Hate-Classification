i hate your comment every citizen of every country has first dibs on rights to live there you cant gatekeep that and tell someone who is a native born citizen of the country that they are nothing special and their contributions mean nothing fuck you for that its their country and their elected officials should represent them whether that happens or not is moot here every citizen of a country us japan mexico india etc has a right to feel pride about living in their country of origin and take pride in whatever contributions they make in their country
