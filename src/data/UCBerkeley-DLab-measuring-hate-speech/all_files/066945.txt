i came out to my parents and they think similarly that its a trend influenced by others or my bf etc i still live with them since im a minor and im broke to move out as soon as im 18 anyways they deadname me and misgender me regardless of telling them otherwise and im going to a gender clinic therapist my advice would be to ignore him and you live your life family isnt people related by blood but those who you choose to be in your life your closest friends partner supportive family members etc j hope you live a good life as yourself man
