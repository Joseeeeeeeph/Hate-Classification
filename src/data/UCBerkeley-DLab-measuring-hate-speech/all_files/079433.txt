thats how civil rights work for minorities  you are sounding like the people back in the 50s and 60s being angry with the black rights movements in a general population the majority tends to discriminate and place massive pressure on minorities  which is why laws are created for protection we cannot trust the majority to love and help minorities its just not in their human nature especially given the comment you just gave
