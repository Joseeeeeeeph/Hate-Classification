obligatory not the other commenter but when i was exploring radical theologies in the death of godchristian atheism vein i couldnt affirm the creeds without crossing my fingers i think this sub affirms various liberation theologies as radical theologies and those certainly dont require any commitments that preclude affirming the creeds to the contrary many liberation theologians have reservations about death of god theologies that dont affirm an actually existing god and the resurrection of the body
