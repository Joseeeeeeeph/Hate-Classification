i like to think im woke but this is one thing i never understood like sure be open and proud of what you are but why does that only apply to minorities better yet why is it that when a majority tries to show pride in what they are its somehow pushing down on the minorities dont get me wrong a lot of minorities have it really tough to this day and they shouldnt have to feel wrong for what they are i have absolutely no problem with a gay pride parade but still dont understand whats so wrong about straight pride
