the only issue i have which isnt really an issue just an observation and opinion is the rights that gaysbis fight for are completely different for what trans fight for sexual attraction and self identity are so different one wants their marriage adoption etc recognized the other wants their gender and name recognized i completely support trans people and their right to be themselves but it doesnt go hand in hand with what gays are fighting for otherwise wed have just one big civil rights group combined with race age handicaps etc
