yeah thats fair i hope it works out well for you but i know personally that its scary to do even if it goes well dont let that discourage you if being out is what you want and if you think youre in a safe enough environment to do so ive faced some transphobic stuff since coming out but all in all my life is so much better now and thats with only maybe a third of people getting my pronouns right but it feels so much better than no one using them
