i saw a rant on fb by a girl who i guess got hit on by a nice guy and i so totally agree with her the reason other get the guys you call assholes is because theyre more then nice nice is boring its not a personality trait because its the bare fucking minimum we want someone whos sweet compassionate loving etc etc i forgot that exact part if you have to say youre a nice guy then youre not youre really a bag of dicks
