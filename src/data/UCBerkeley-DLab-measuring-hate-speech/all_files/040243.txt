ahhh i see but i mean as a member of the lgbtq community i gotta say that not being blatantly discriminatory shouldnt count as support like she supports candidates that are pushing policies that allow lgbtq people to be fired or refused service but shes not gonna judge me cool would rather not be fired for talking about my same sex relationship but thanks i guess also political groupchat pulled through and just i just dont respect people who talk about human beings as infestations six months after claiming to care about their rights url
