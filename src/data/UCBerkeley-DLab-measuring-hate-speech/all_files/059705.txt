came out to my friends via a game of paranoia the question was something like who do you have a crush on and i said the name of a dude in the group that i actually did at one point have a thing for it was kinda my fault for taking the gamble of outing myself over a game of rock paper scissors but afterwards my friend asked me if i was bi and i was like yeah and she smiled and said you should be proud of that im proud of you and i felt a lot better afterwards still havent come out to my family tho idk how im gonna do that
