local lgbt groups will probably have the best info about what coming out in your area is like and where to get more support for example i live on the east edge of iowakind of iowas east coast which trends more supportive than the deeper red western iowa i dont know what utah is like for trans people i hear more from atheists trying to navigate mormon dominated areas general advise is strength in numbers avoid situations where likely transphobes have it and find numbers to help you
