ever since i was little i just felt like at one point in time i was native american sure it could be because i loved pocahontas but another one of my favorite movies was aladdin and i have never felt a connection to that movie i would love to do some past life regression to see if its accurate but i just feel like i was for some reason i just feel very connected to american indians
