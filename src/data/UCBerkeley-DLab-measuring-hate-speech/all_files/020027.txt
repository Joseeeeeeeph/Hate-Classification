i am a former catholic who struggled so so hard to accept first my sexuality and then my gender identity and i know how much work it takes to mentally and emotionally overcome that pre programmed guilt and self loathing im so happy and proud that you are learning to accept yourself and be free of all that you will be so much happier that way
