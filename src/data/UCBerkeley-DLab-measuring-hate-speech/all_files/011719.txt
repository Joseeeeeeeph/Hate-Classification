my biggest regret in college i just graduated was not finding queer friends that were specifically women i know several cis gay men and unfortunately we rarely relate to one another i never really found queer friends in college and its one of my biggest regrets that being said i did witness a girl i know make a lot of friends through my universitys twitter crowd she basically tweeted who wants to be in my queer girl squad and that worked for her people started messaging her to hangout
