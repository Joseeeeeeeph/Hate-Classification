its hard to predict how people will react to their significant other cross dressing tolerance doesnt always equal unconditional acceptance and im sorry that you had to discover that the hard way you have been open and honest about your desire to express your feminine side i think its time for your partner to share her feelings about your cross dressing and tell you what she can and cant live with she might not give you the answer you want to hear but at least youll know where she stands i hope it works out for you
