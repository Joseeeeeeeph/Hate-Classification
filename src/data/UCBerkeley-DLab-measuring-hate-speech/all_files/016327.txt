you could look at that way or that shes arguing against the initial non sequitur itself if someone simply blurts out to pence stop killing blacks theres nothing wrong with responding that the more pressing concern is black on black violence itself again it might be a lightning rod comment but its not racist its like gun right advocates pushing for mental health reform whenever theres a mass shooting and everyone yells for gun control
