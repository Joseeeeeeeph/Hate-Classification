honestly i understand the reason for it i dont think the lgbtq community is oppressed but it wasnt that long ago that they were while they arent oppressed by our government many in the community especially teens often arent accepted by their families and are often disowned and abused pride month is a way of acknowledging the progress thats been made and supporting those in the community that are still vulnerable i dont understand why people cant simply ignore it if they dont want to be involved instead of being actively against it they arent hurting anyone
