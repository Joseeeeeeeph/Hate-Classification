yes hes such a loving god lets see what god says about people and animals in levitcus 2621 22 if you remain hostile toward me and refuse to obey i will inflict you with seven more disasters for your sins i will release wild animals that will kill your children and destroy your cattle so your numbers will dwindle and your roads will be deserted i can just feel the love but remember that he loves you
