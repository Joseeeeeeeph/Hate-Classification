thank you the clarifies things a bit more jesus another jew came to provide a way for anyone to be saved and walk with god jesus followers can be jews or non jews that absolutely helps if im understanding correctly jesus provided the path for those who were not gods chosen i like that its not the way i was taught which led to much of my confusion
