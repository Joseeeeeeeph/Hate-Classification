as a white woman who mostly works on issues that affect my community who are mostly white women i do wish i knew how to be more welcoming to black women and women of other ethnic backgrounds it seems like theres an unsurmountable barrier between us one where i present ideas that i feel may solve many problems for a lot of women regardless of race or class and i get rebuked by youre just talking about this because youre privileged i dont want to play the rich white saviours here but i also want to help as many women as i can reach independence its just such a conundrum
