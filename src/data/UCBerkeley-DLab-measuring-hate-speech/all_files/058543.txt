its fine to be upset rejection and sexual frustration are upsetting and you should be allowed to vent your frustrations in a constructive supportive environment it is not fine to advocate threaten or condone rape if you think women deserve to be raped because you havent found someone willing to let you flail pathetically around on them for 43 seconds then i think you deserve to cry alone rotting in your semen encrusted underwear alone until you die alone
