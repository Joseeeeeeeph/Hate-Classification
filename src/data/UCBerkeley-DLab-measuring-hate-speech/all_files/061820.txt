one look at my husband and its pretty obvious hes not arab so i personally think it would look ridiculous on him im a pale white convert and i would look ridiculous in a shalwar kameez since its obviously not from my culture thankfully i look pretty turkish even though im not and most turkish people have similar skin tones as i do so a turkish hijab looks natural on me
