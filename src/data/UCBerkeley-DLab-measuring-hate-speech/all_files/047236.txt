well the us is a radical secular organization most likely your own govt is too hamas islamic affiliation is not really relevant they have been elected in gaza because they have demonstrated the strongest commitment to resistance of the occupation any siege of their land by radical zionists hamas was only created after 40 years of israeli ethnic cleansing dispossession oppression and subjugation of gazans and all palestinians so dont throw stones without examining the root causes and the radical organizations who have made their existence inevitable
