dont talk or fuck co workers or girls with boyfriends if youre afraid of being hurt again then dont date girls with baggage that are probably on the rebound or dealing with exes crazy idea i know lastly i have never ever met a girl with a pattern of fucked relationships that admit its her fault weird they are perfect just cute victims of their circumstances
