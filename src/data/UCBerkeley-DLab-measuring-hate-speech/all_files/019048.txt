thats based on a hadith where the guy killed 150 people was on his way to ask about allah died in the desert allah decreed for the distance he traveled to the city to ask about forgiveness if it was half he was forgiven he then moved the earth to skew the measurement i believe this was from muhammad himself still if the people he killed were pagans or christians or jews we are the worst of creatures according to the quran and hell will be our dwelling
