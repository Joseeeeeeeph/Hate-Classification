dont ever think you understand fully no one ever will so so true and also if anyone else acts like they understand everything fully they are misled just as you dont comprehend the full nature of the mystery of christ neither do those conservatives who act like they have definitively interpreted the bible and in my experience many of them dont act with much humility when they are out judging others
