i lived at home with my parents for the 6 months after graduating college before moving to la i worked full time and saved most of my money and moved out with a few friends from college once i lived with them and realized how bad of roommates they were i started saving my money once more so i could move out and live on my own i suggest finding a roommate or two that you absolutely trust and know well saving on rent will help you a lot
