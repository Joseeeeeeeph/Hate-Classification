i agree with the poster who recommended ash hardell their videos helped me a lot when i started to realize i was trans back in january i still feel weird saying im trans and havent come out yet i feel like trans masc describes me best for now i understand the urge to immediately find the words to match how you identify but if youre only just starting to figure it out take your time theres no rush to pic a label and live with it forever
