i know straight couples who do it im in one for me sex has always been casual and fun not really tied to love or romance were in our 20s and look good we still are attracted to other guys and we like to go out and pick up boys either together or apart sometimes our tastes diverge we keep not excessive and at the end of the day we live together and come home to each other with stories usually its fine not for everyone and also not for every relationship i probably wouldnt do this in any other relationship but it works here
