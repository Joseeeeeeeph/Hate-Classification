i truly dont understand this mindset its like some people have never been to actual pride at our local pride we have so many local groups walking my favorite every year is the group of lgbt parents and their kids its fucking cute man and if i ever decide to have kids then i know there is a group for me to get advice and guidance from i go to pride with my husband and friends and then we end up at someones place talking and being grateful to live in a time that we can do this without fearing death but i guess all of that to you is a fleeting moment of fun phew man you are jaded af
