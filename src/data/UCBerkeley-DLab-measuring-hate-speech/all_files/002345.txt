nobody disney producers ok were proud to announce that mulan will be played by a latina girl smart disney director no the story of mulan is based on the legendary woman in chinese history named hue mulan changing her race would not only reduce the representation of asian actors in film but also go against the origin of the source material that it was based on disney producers when you put it that way i guess itd be pretty stupid to do that
