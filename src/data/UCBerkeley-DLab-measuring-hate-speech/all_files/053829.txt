i actually think youre doing it right if thats how you approach it semi casual with some hints of you should care a bit more about being private with it wish my mom was like that it was extremely formal how she approached it with me birds and bees and i was embarrassed and wanting to die but to her credit she was always supportive of both my siblings and my sexuality and letting us know where the condoms were at and to not get a girl preggers she always said that it doesnt matter if were gay or trans or whatever as long as were happy so far so good on the happy part
