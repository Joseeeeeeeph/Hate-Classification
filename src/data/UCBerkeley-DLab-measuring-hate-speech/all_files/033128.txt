but you did say that talent should be the only consideration i would argue that having a black disney princess has benefits that should make it a consideration no it wont solve everything but i think its pretty easy to see how it could help black girls when you consider how under represented they are in media and again i fully agree that disney is only doing whats best for their company call it pandering if you want but its really just marketing
