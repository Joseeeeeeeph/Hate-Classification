i love that the muslim women in congress are so progressive and stand up for everyones rights op also posted this on rislam and people are hating cause she went to pride parade i dont want to participate in that sub because its toxic but i will say that as a bi muslim seeing a muslim politician go to pride warmed my heart a lot of us wouldnt be accepted by our own families and friends but knowing that ilhan was willing to put herself out there even though she must have been aware of how muslims would react is truly inspiring
