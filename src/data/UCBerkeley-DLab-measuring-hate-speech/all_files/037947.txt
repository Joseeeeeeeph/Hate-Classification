i appreciate your posting this i could not agree with you more i have the privilege of ministering to evangelical young people often and it continually amazes me that they have the same deep questions that we catholics do however they seem to not know that there is such a wealth of wisdom and knowledge from our ancestors in the faith i dont want to be disrespectful but it seems at times that it has never even dawned on them that christianity is an ancient faith with everything that antiquity means and not a contemporary emotional experience
