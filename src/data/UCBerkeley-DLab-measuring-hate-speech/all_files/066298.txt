im mixed asian and thats one of my favorite part of the community they really love their children and want them to succeed at all costs asian parents will work their ass off the send their kids to college instill them with good ethics but they arent always the best at showing or saying love outright theres many pros and cons to the ways different cultures raise their kids and i just wanted to say no one group is all good or all bad
