ya know there is no feeling more universally bisexual than self consciousness over whether youre actually bi or bi enough or bi enough to fit in in the lgbt community or whether you can be lgbt in a straight relationship or whether youre actually just an imposter or i could go on and on just know that these feelings are 100 extremely common in bi people i can relate to all this i know its easier said than done but try not to let these feelings get to you too much youre bi and you belong in the lgbt community as much as any other lgbt person
