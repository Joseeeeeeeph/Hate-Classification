im curious why you feel that homosexuality is unhealthy do you have any good research that you could recommend for me to read ive only read research that shows that cures for homosexuality tend to result in major depressive disorder anxiety disorders and suicide and because of the values i hold i am opposed to that kind of result if that research is wrong though id like to know so i can revise my stance
