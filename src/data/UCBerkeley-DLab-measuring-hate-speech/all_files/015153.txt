so if a woman owns her body and no one can tell her what to do with it why do we have suicide hotlines to try and stop suicidal women its their body if a suicidal woman is on a ledge about to jump the firemen should say nothing we can do its her body but we will lay down a tarp so it doesnt splatter blood all over the sidewalk okay lady were ready you can jump now i wonder how people like joy behar would feel about that
