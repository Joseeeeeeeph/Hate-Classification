im still not sure if im bisexual but for some reason i loveee feminine looking boys the pretty ones ive never felt a thing for girls so maybe its because my culture favours pretty boys over masculine men east asian cultural sphere or am i just after that angelic unreal look or maybe im secretly bisexual but i lied to myself so much it became a habit lol or is it because i read too many bl not gonna lie i came here to look for lovely gay stories
