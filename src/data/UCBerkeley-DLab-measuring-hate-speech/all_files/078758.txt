i really dont want to sound like a bigot but just understand thats not my heart on this extremely feminine men and extremely masculine women make me feel uncomfortable i think its built out of a perspective of gender norms and expectations and when those are broken i feel almost as if im witnessing a person in disguise its really hard to get that perspective out of my head
