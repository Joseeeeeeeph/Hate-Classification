youre right the ottomans only murdered 4000 and enslaved 30000 during the conquest of constantinople instituted a system where they enslaved christian children forcibly converted them to islam and sent them to massacre their own people and committed the first genocide in modern history the epitome of tolerance thats not even going into things like the batak massacre and the atrocities they committed to keep a hold of the balkans
