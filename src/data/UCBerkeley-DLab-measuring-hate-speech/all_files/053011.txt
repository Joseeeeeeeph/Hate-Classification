im a guy who likes women in general i prefer women who present feminine so alternative style may turn me off as fair as hair color goes it depends ive seen a lot of women color their hair in a way that just isnt flattering given the color and style ive also seen women color their hair in a way thats wonderful and attractive i think the main difference is the degree of care going into the hair in question the colored hair i find attractive seems healthy and full even if its been colored
