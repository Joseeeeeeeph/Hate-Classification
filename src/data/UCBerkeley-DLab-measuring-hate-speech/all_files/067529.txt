so growing up in a very religious family i never even thought i might not be straight until just over a year ago it finally clicked and now im coming to terms with my sexuality only my partner knows its hard to sit at family dinners and hear my familys harsh opinions about the lgbtq community also its hard coming to terms with the fact that ive never been able to explore the side of me that is attracted to women im content but boy did i miss a lot of opportunities lol
