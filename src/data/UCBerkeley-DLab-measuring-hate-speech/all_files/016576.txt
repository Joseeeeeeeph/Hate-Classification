as a woman myself it really pisses me off that there is an assumption made that we should vote for someone simply because they are a woman this is no different than voting a straight party ticket or letting your union tell you who to vote for i have no problems voting for a woman and i like warren quite a bit but i dont like her cause she is a woman i didnt vote for obama because he was black nor did i vote for clinton because he was white we should each and every one of us vote for the candidate that we feel is best suited to do the job regardless of race gender or sexual orientation
