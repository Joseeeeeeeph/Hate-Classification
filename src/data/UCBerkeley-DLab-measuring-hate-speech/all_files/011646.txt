 many countries in europe are more advanced in many ways and none of us want to be american ​ wow thats crazy i guess all the immigrants just made a wrong left turn at the pacific ocean and kept driving for a few thousand miles leading to them accidentally crossing an international border and deciding to settle down in the states ​ you know what why dont you keep your dumb ass on the other side of the pond i think we will be better off that way
