this is the level of toxicity that my ex wife thrived in she used to block me ignore me lock me out because in her head if i kept trying to fix things then that meant i loved her and im not just a crazy stalker if i ever just said no fuck that im not gonna do it wanna block me fine then we wont talk or ill just sleep on the couch shed have a royal melt down and escalate the argument to new extremes god that woman made me want to die so if you ever find a girl who actually thinks like this run far far away because every single day with that woman was torture
