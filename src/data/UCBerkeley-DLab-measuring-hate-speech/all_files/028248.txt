white is such a weird category its not a real thing there isnt a white culture what would that be bagpipes from ireland and pierogi from poland is that the same culture and the distinction between white and non white is not genetically meaningful either there is no white nor brown nor black nor any other clean category like that where you can neatly fit people into so stop being offended over some imaginary category you dont fit into because it doesnt exist
