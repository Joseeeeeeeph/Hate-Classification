it felt a little wierd and at the end i felt disappointed then i wondered why cause there was no discussion beginnedbut then there are you can come up with the conclusion you want mine is that it made me think about how even black people are biased toward a lighter skin and not just to lighten the burden of discrimination on their kids its also found more beautiful really racism discrimination of ones race goes so deep that even the people that are targetted by it end up to kind of have that thinking too toward each other
