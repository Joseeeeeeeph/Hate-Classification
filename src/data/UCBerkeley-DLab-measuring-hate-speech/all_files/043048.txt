i do think in my opinion there is problems with the equality act in that it takes an all or nothing approach like we need the equality act but i as a trans woman i dont think i belong in every womans space especially prior to transitioning if you dont take hrt but identify as trans thats fine but i dont think competing with biological woman should be allowed in sports i think theres a compromise here somewhere
