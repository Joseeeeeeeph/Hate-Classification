i think that being trans has totally shaped the way i view the world and the way i connect to it it shapes the art i make and the things i write the way i interact with people the way i move through life i like being trans and deaf especially because asl is a beautiful language and i think i can express my gender better with asl than i ever can in english sometimes i hate this shit but i dont think i would give it up i dont think im proud of it yet either but i know ill get there picking my own name was also pretty dope
