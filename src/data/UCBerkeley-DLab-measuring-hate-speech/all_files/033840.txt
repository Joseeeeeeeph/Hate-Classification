dude if you live in a city with a lot of illegal immigrants its almost stupid to hire legal workers for the same work the chances of getting caught are so slim its worth the risk and if caught the damages are negligible compared to the utility you get out of illegal workers if it was *actually* risky to hire an illegal immigrant even one time then that would cut our immigration problem by half or more
