i used to be an er nurse and listening to my coworkers trash lgbtq patients used to infuriate me so i would always volunteer to care for them i take care to ask about preferred pronouns and try to provide relevant discharge information i hope to become a nurse practitioner and focus on providing comprehensive open primary care to lgbtq community in my area i live in sc and we are 4450 in primary care and when you look at the wpath registered providers for our state there are no primary care or endocrinologists listed just counselors most of them social workers
