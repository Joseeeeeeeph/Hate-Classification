im living somewhat in the middle of those two cultures what i mean is im from czechia polands neighbor and due to the immense secularization process my country underwent during the last 100 years especially during the 40 year communist regime our country cannot be considered catholic though it is the biggest religion here i feel for the polish people but i cannot get behind attacking people on the street solely because of their lgbt convictions and i find such extremes are becoming too common in catholic societies
