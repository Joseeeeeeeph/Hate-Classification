that gives me a leg to stand on in defending my feelings on this more than you know i want the world for her and this shit would not fly huge thank you for this perspective and i totally agree that the pressure is real i know i feel it but i dont want to feel it anymore he wasnt some troglodyte going to sleazy places when i married him and my standards are still the same so i hear what youre saying in making sure i remember to watch my own ass in this situation instead of worrying about his feelings
