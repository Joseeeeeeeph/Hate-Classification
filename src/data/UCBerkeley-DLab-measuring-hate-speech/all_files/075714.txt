as someone who has been in denial for 15 years and has awful gender dysphoria every day i think its important that even if i do transition i talk about the injustices that i face because of the fact that i am born and raised female it is upsetting and hurts to talk about but it cannot be ignored it seems lke people pay more attention to trans women because it is more revolutionary for a mtf to transition than a ftm because they are doing what patriarchal society is telling them not to do to reject masculinity in favor of femininity
