that may be the case for some people but i wasnt properly raised in the church technically i was but my parents never by pressure on me and my siblings to be a part of it and i even have a sibling who doesnt i genuinely didnt believe in the church until recently and i would only go to church to see my friends when i wanted to but i decided to make the change for myself and not because anyone pressured me so in my case youre wrong
