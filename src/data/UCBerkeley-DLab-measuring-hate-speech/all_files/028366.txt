1 it wouldnt surprise me as some sects uphold different rituals than others that isnt my experience but i havent done enough research on that topic to answer it completely 2 i can only speak for myself but being raised christian i fully respect other religions my personal beliefs are that there are multiple routes to the same destination as for the wider community i saw a lot of tolerance but i also saw a lot of intolerance i think overall jews just keep their opinions to themselves especially the from birthers
