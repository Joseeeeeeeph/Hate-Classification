im 53 its never really hindered me except for feeling insecure about being seen as not masculine but i moved on from that because its something i cant change and im a masculine person in dating if hasnt really affected me luckly i have been in a steady relationship with a girl whos actually 62 i think it shows that height might be a deal breaker for some but definitely not all women potienal partners think like that
