jesus thats a name i havent heard in a long time haha ​ but honestly i dont agree with a single thing he says but what has him being anti semitic got to do with the justice system ​ a guy who murdered people and burned churches in the past has now been free for years and hasnt committed any crimes since as far as im aware at least ​ thats a testament to their system if you ask me
