you snowflakes are being too mean to dave rubin you overly sensitive pc jerks are mocking rubin for his ideas and content he sells rather than his sexuality he should be nicer like shapiro who doesnt criticize poor ideas and instead refuses to celebrate rubins identity family and legal status as married to his face on his very own show you see sticking to the principle that ideas should be supported with facts and consistent logic is an asshole move but sticking to the principle that gay sex is icky and gay dudes are abominations that should be criminalized is how nice people behave
