i have done a lot of mission work myself in several locations however i can still admit there are huge problems with bigotry inside my church many people do these good works for a self serving purpose that doesnt diminish the good that is done though additionally churches generally have other fund raising for these purposes and many missions are self funded finally a lot of these programs are government funded so claiming to be against government involvement is also disingenuous
