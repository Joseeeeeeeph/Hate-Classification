okay now i would love to point out all the mistakes in this but i think everyone else got the greenlight before i did d honestly if youre going to do a match up with ben dont go with his ten year version do at least his teenage counterpart secondly you probably couldve picked someone else for him to go up against i dont think this was a good match up and was doomed from the start not to mention there was way more build up than there was action
