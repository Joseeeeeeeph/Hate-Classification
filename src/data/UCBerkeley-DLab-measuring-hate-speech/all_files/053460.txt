no its basically throwing in the token black character or the token gay character or the token female strong character for just a few scenes to say that they are being progressive that to me is fake equality if you care about diversity i feel you should develop a well rounded character and let them shine on there own i remember when marvel made a new iron man a black girl and i was against that because what is wrong with giving this new character her own super hero with her own universe
