as a gay person in the animation field its very important for kids to have some kind of representation in their media i feel like if id been given some clue in childhood that what i was or wasnt feeling was normal i feel like i could have started living my life earlier i often think about how much i wish i could have come out as a preteen i could have been comfortable with myself earlier and i think it really held me back socially
