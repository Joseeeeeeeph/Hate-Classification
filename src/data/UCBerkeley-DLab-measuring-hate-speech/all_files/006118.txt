thats just not fair poverty and poor families are ever where if your poor and down on your luck its just the hand your dealt black or white i wouldnt be so quick to blame others everyone has to pick themselves up without blames or excuses whats next if a race was known to have a certain sickness than others what are they going to blame them for that to being poor or rich isnt supposed to happen to certain people what ever you end up being one only hopes and prays everyone is capable of doing the best you can do
