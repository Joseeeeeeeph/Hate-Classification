protestants tend to think of that as a single thing faith which works through love and orthodox think of it as two things faith and works it seems to me that it is protestantism which separates faith and works into two things before the reformation i dont think the distinction faith on the one hand and works on the other would have made much sense to ordinary christian people there was simply the life of christian discipleship
