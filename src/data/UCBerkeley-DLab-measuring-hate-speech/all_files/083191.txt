i feel like lots of non asian americans or mixed asian americans like me are justscared of us for situations and ideals like these i hope our generation can break this cycle but it doesnt seem possible additionally i think the reason why each school genuinely seems to have a few asian groups is because only we can deal with or understand these kind of unhealthy discussions because its how weve grown up and that really says something i agree with all you said
