totally understand your uncle and appreciate your post its something i accepted a long time ago and really there is no need for anyone to recognize it in a celebratory way my family has known for years but at every family celebration or gathering my cousin has to bring it up like its a badge of honor or something i think its so marvelous that j has been with x all these years the world needs more gay people like them oh wtf shut up it actually embarrasses her more than us because shes trying too hard to be inclusive or something bless her heart lol
