its just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay because i doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if being white in the us will be perceived as a problem the very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist but the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts
