my experience on rturkey and even rturkeyjerky has been the same even though the memes are pretty funny it doesnt help that a lot of people see the current government as islamic and therefore project their dissatisfaction of the government as dissatisfaction of religion however they also seem to have a pseudo nationalistic attitude where they simultaneously profess their love for the country and also bash the people living there it is crucial to self critique however mocking and not providing alternativessolutions is not the right way to go about it to each to their own i guess
