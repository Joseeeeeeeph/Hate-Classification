i love you but if you make that decision in life i cant be there for you anymore context i identified as trans for a while and thought that i had to transition my mum basically was like you can choose between having a family or transitioning  its still your choice though in the end it doesnt really matter what the context was phrases that start with i love you *but* are always bad
