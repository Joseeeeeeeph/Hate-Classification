that scene was a little bit forced and cringey honestly it wasnt really necessary one good thing that came out of this though is that all them female superheroes were looking dope all coming together in their cool ass outfits that would have made a good scene if it made more sense and the dialogue was better and more profound you cant deny that unless you really am are a sexist
