i agree with your perspective on white but i too will say he has been a great blessing in my life his extensive library of debates has been extremely helpful to me as a young christian after my near death experience and dedication to christ i came upon his videos and they have changed my life forever everyone has an ego in one way or another and we all have struggles but i would say him and jeff are definitely loud and proud about their possition sometimes its good sometimes it works against them in my opinion but none the less they are both a blessing to this generation
