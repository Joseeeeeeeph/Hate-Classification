youre right i didnt think about that and we should be raising our children to not discriminate regarding of race wealth social status etc just treat someone how you would like to be treated i just dont feel right when you point out the race of children when trying to make the point of not treating people of a different financial standing shes profiling the children at the same time as shes teaching a lesson of compassion
