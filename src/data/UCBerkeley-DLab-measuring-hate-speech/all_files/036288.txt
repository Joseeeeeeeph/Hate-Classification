so many people including over half of the damn country figured out that owning raping and murdering people based on their skin color is wrong im sad that those who didnt were willing to murder fellow americans to continue to rape murder and otherwise profit from the incredible suffering they happily inflicted upon other human beings i am also sad that the decendants of these unfortunate people need to constantly deal with people like you who trivialize slavery and the injustice that continues to exist because of it and the policies that followed it
