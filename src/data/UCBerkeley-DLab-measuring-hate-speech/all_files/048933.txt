i was also sort of curious about this because when i was a teenager i was filling out the application to work at a girl guide camp and it asked me to write a paragraph about christianity i dont remember the exact question but my family was detached enough from religion that i didnt fill it out because i didnt know that catholicism was a part of christianity i had been in girl guides several years and they made us pray at every meal no excuses but theyre books and stuff preached diversity
