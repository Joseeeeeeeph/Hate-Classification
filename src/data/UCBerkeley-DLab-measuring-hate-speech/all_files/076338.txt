you have already said that even if there was 100% proof that trans women had no advantage over cis women then you still wouldnt accept trans women in womens sport so youre not really being rational on this topic meanwhile back in the world that i live in there are no trans women who are world champions of their sport no trans women who hold a world record in any event no trans women that are olympic medalists in fact so far no trans women that even made an olympic team that doesnt align with your assumption that a penis magically gives you sporting prowess
