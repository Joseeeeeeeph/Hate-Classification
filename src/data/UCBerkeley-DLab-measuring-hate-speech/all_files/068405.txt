i definitely understand where you are coming from dont worry its impossible to offend me lol im just trying to give you a little insight into the problem with these types of debates and taking a hard stance one way or another these are completely subjective beliefs and there is no hard evidence to help either side so its best to just be tolerant of what people believe and respect them even if you disagree and of course your sister should also respect your beliefs as well i also come from a muslim family i understand how frustrating this can be believe me
