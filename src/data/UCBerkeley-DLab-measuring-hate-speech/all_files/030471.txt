in new orleans we call it passe blanc which means passing for white it was a way of survival in those days my great grandmother passe blanc for most of her life because she was a registered nurse and many white people didnt want colored girls touching them she passed away at 95 and refused to say she was black i wouldnt do that at this point in my life but since i understand the circumstances she was forced to live under i get it she wanted more for her family and saying she was black would be a hindrance in the 1940s
