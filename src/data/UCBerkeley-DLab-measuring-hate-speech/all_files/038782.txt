honestly i spent the first 5 or so years of being bi so starting at age 18 or 19 or so feeling this way but that has slowly changed not that it matters since im in a mostly monogamous relationship with a woman but if something was to happen and we broke up i would not exclusively date women i think im just saying that these things can change over time too
