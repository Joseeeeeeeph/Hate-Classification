i figured out i wasnt cis in may 2017 and then started testosterone in march of 2019 so i spent a solid 2 years with living as a guy although not always passable i started t 2 months before my 16th birthday and im happier then i ever have been in my life i think if someone has known for a few years and is fairly certain they are trans 14 is the bare minimum that someone should be allowed on cross sex hormones 13 is definitely too young 14 is still iffy but i can see a 14 year old on hormones
