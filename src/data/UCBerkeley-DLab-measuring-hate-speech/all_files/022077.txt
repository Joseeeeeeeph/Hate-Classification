i feel fortunate that the koa my family visits is staffed with wonderful people i know this sort of overt racism is still alive and well but its still shocking to see it these awful people are emboldened by the times and sadly i expect well see more of it all we can do is refuse to be a complaisant bystander and call the police record what we can and call for justice to be done im so sorry this couple were faced with such a situation thank you for your service sir all the best to you and your family
