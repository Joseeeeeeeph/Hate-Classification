thats a very good response and i respect you a lot for being very respectful i do still disagree with you about muslims as a whole given that statistically speaking my experience is a lot more valid as an indicator how they are as a group i will however take what you wrote into consideration and i might change my mind at some point in the future i cant say that im fully convinced right now but i cant say that you are completely wrong either
