setting aside the history discussion i hope all indians both minorities and majorities stay and surge confidently in nation building instead of feeling victimized by psuedo secularist politicians in current govt there wont be either appeasement of minority religion or thrusting of majority religion on anyone the focus is development and empowerment and upliftment of needy people religion is a personal matter and hopefully in future it will cease to be a cause of worry
