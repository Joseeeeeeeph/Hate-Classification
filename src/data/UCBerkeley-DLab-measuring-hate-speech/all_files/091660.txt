i feel like no one studies history anymore do you know why are navy was created i know it happened 200 years ago but it still matters today americas was constantly being attacked by muslims seriously america has been fighting against the islamic regime since our independence before that europe sent the christian crusaders to fight the muslims killings its been a cancer on earth for over 1400 years no other religion in the world calls for others to die or be killed simply for being a non believer except the muslims religion
