to me its better than being atheist thoughif i was not catholic i guess i would at the very least be agnostic or spiritual to be clear atheism wasnt a choice i made i didnt wake up one day and say nah i dont feel like being catholic anymore it was just something i became convinced of as i grew older i guess my point is that on the most fundamental level people become catholic because they are convinced it is true likewise people leave the catholic faith when they are no longer convinced it is true the same is true with any faith or non faith
