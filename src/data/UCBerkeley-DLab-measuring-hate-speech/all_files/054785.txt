i dont believe the line of questioning about your move to cut your daughters hair is rooted in malice possibly if i may as an african american woman for so long we thought our identity was rooted in our hair for example the good hair complex it stems from our horrible past as slaves through jim crow and present day racism no we are not our hair but we are always judged from head to toe also it was hard to watch robin 2nd guess her decision to cut her hair but i hope she maintains the level of confidence and pride you were cheering her on with in the video
