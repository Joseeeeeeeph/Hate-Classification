when it comes to denominations i am usually reminded of 1 corinthians 3 we as believers are called to be united as one body i believe we all need each other baptists catholics pentecostal etc to encourage each other sharpen one another and bear each others burdens there are aspects of the catholic church that i wish pentecostals would pick up and vice versa i dont think it matters what denomination you choose the only thing that does matter is that jesus is your lord that you seek to glorify his name and that you show his love to others
