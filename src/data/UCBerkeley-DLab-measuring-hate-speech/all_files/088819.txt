anybody is welcome to attend a catholic mass or an orthodox liturgy the only request is that you dont partake in the eucharist you can cross your arms for a blessing though ive been to a few different protestant services with my wifes family and personally i find them to benot as deep as a catholic mass so that might be your issue to all of your other issues i can understand the denominations being the biggest issue i think but i understand what the root cause of it is authority
