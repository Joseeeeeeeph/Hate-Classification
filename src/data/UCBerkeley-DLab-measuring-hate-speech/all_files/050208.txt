thats a little uncharitable im not a white nationalist nor do i want to keep the races separate i dont mean to be uncharitable there but i was trying to be clear on why i think your statement was so concerning i dont think youre a white nationalist and im glad that you have made this statement to clarify that and my point is that different cultures should be celebrated instead of muted i think we can all agree about that
