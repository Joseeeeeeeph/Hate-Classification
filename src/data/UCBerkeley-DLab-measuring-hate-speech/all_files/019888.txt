while i disagree with your take on brownblackface i appreciate that you make the effort to be sensitive to the minorities there are many things that we can disagree on on the basis of religion race personal beliefs amongst other but being observant and making an effort to make others feel comfortable is what truly makes a gracious and multi cultural society
