mormons are completely unwilling to be confrontational towards strangers they might yell at their kids for being gay but they dont have the guts to yell at a stranger for the same thing its why utah has such a reputation for passive aggressiveness people here are raised to shame people within their social circle for being deviant but they cant handle anyone outside their socialreligious circle not that im complaining it makes judgemental people here easy to deal with by simply ignoring them
