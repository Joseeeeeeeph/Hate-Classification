my grandma is italian her parents came through ellis island in the 1910s and even if thats only 25% of my dna i still like to tell people that im italian because she was the only one of my grandparents who took the time to teach me about my heritage like yeah im an american and thats important to me but the italian culture my grandma passed down to me is also important if i met someone actually from italy i wouldnt say im italian too because im not really but i might still tell them that thats where some of my family is from
