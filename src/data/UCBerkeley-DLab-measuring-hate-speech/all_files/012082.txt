recently broke up and out of my first relationship who happens to also be a girl mom brought this up and said have you ever thought maybe it didnt work out because she was well you know a girl my mom has clarified to me she doesnt want me to be bi because of the hardships couples face but is completely fine with me being bi because she is an accepting person i completely understand her reasoning and her heart is in the right place but my ex just wasnt the right person  and no what was between her legs wasnt the problem
