but how is it any different than giving your child a gendered name thats why i dont really get the hate for gender reveal parties its just people having fun and i know parents who do it who are also super supportive of trans people myself and my friends and something like 99 of people will give their kids gendered names which essentially do the same thing reveal the genitals of their children but were not all up in arms about that
