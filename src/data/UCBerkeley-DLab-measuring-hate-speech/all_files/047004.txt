i think it would help to talk to your grandma about her views on lgbtq people before coming out to her does your family ever talk about politics you could try to pepper it into conversation or ask your parents to bring it up sometime if theyre comfortable with that like have them bring up some kind of law regarding lgbtq rights and see what she has to say the biggest thing about coming out is to make sure youll feel safe and loved and if you know someone is going to ridicule you for it sometimes its better to wait until they dont have any control over you i hope all goes well
