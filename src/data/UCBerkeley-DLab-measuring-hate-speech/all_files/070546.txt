i cant believe we dont teach that jesus is our mediator but he is our mediator by extension of the governing body that makes so sense to me that was the one that really pushed me over the edge because that means my sins cant be forgiven until they all die or that my prayers arent heard i truly dont understand how he isnt our mediator
