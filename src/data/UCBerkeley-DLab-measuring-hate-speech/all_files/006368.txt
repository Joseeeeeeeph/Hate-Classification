how is anyone supposed to know i dont get how someone could watch a game like the last ncaa womens basketball championship and think that was a bad game because women were playing it without being an unrepentant misogynist and for someone on an nba star level i would bet the majority of them just love the game enough to give the ladies their due might be biased though being from a state where our only bball pride comes from the womens game
