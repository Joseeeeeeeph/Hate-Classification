my wifes family is catholic i was confirmed through rcia as an adult before determining i couldnt believe any of it there are undeniably lots of catholics that agree with what i am saying but still identify as catholic they are not the ones giving money to support the church i convinced my wife to leave the catholic church a few years ago and she admits it was one of the best decisions she ever made
