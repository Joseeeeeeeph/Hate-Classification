im horrified to hear that i just made a video about the gay community and my thoughts on it weve all been through the pain of coming out weve all been through the fear of having that close call and being tested and afraid so instead of hate why dont we support each other through our shared experiences and hardships that we all have in common i just dont understand why we dont band together and support one another instead of this bizarre gay community we have at the moment which is all about tribes and socks and superficial irrelevant bs
