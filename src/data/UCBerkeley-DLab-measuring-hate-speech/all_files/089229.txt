i definitely did when i first came out i wanted to avoid the label trans because literally the only thing i knew about trans people was that life is kinda hard for them so my friend suggested that i might just be genderfluid instead and i used that label for a solid year or so before i discovered im actually more binary than i thought its still a wonderful identity and it sparked a lot of the critical thinking i did about gender through my transition
