yep nta my mom is a practicing catholic my sister is getting married and she is not neither is her fiancee my mom is ok with them eloping its cheaper and it doesnt make sense to have a full catholic ceremony for two people who arent catholic it is the equivalent of having a play or charade of a catholic ceremony none of the essential actors are catholic they would only be pretending it no more catholic then eloping her feeling is if they ever convert they can just do a catholic ceremony further down although she doesnt expect my sister and her future husband to convert at all
