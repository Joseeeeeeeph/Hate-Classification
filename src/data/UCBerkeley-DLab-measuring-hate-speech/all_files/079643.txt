really the dawnguard just kinda pop up out of nowhere with no introduction other than big orc man hunting you down the bos has the massive scene with the prydwyn and all the vertibirds flying over you with the fallout 4 theme playing i dont think ive ever gotten chills from a bethesda game like that since the oblivion intro
