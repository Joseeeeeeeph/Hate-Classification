i am a cis man in a relationship with a transman i understand your plight entirely hell i dont think it even dawned on me that there may be an opposite to transwomen until i met my current so boy did i feel ignorant this whole ride has taught me a lot about people i never even considered i see exactly what you describe in his relationships with others in the lgbtq community and i just dont understand it just know i love you you are just as important as any one else in the community in my eyes and i hope one day we can all live and love happily under the same umbrella
