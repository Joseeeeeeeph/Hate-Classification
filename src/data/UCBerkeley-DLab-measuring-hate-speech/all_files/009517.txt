i hold doors open for everyone because i appreciate it when people do so for me \ this should suffice i think irrespective of gender i guess some people just like finding faults in other people and act our in bad faith weve become fear based and hyperemotional i think this is a catastrophic combination and makes us prone and primed for manipulation and populism if we worry about whos holding up the door were more likely to miss bigger and more important issues
