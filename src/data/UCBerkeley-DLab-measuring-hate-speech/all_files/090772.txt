hey thanks for sharing that i feel you from the other side of things passing isnt always a priority and most trans girls think that to pass you have to look magazine perfect nut thats giving passersby more credit on their perception checks than most ppl actually deserve tbh im not a brick even tho i dont pass but i still dont encounter much shit from ppl bless ugly women who remind me that women look all different types of ways i hope you can find something that helps you feel more comfortable and if you ever wanna reach out feel free to send me a message
