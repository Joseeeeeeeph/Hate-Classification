op and some of you in here are actual morons that are being willfully ignorant of the difference even using the twitter moron as an example not all furries are zoophiles are there zoophiles that are furries though yeah but furries arent about having sex with real animals same logic goes here not all lolishotacons are pedophiles are there pedophiles that are lolicons though yeah but lolicons arent about having sex with real kids merging the two groups as one shows your own bias and preconceived notion of what something is because you dont like it
