not gay but bi so close enough i dont dress overly girly or overly masculine i dont go out of my way to really dress any certain style i just go with what i like i do think its good to have a degree of anonymity so everyone doesnt judge subconsciously or consciously you right away however they wont tend to take you seriously when you mention youre lgbt like i could say im interested in girls as a girl myself and if i dont look the part or like a stereotype then it might be hard for many people to believe you
