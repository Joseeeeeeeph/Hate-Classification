see i had this mindset too i liked this boy since fourth or fifth grade but i just thought nah too depressed and wishy washy for a relationship besides id die in the process of trying to ask him out i didnt even know if the guy was gay but then suddenly whoa he confesses to me and we both have heart attacks so now were getting married and everyone is invited sometimes things will just come along for you he was certainly the last thing i ever expected to really truly be in my life and im happy
