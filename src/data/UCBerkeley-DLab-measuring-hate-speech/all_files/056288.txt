reddit is mostly made up of middle upper middle class they dont have to compete for their jobs with illegal immigrants so its easy for them to ignore the damage they cause my fave argument is when people say are you going to pick fruits for a few bucks an hour like the companies would be able to pay so little without illegal immigrants existing in the country they would have to pay an acceptable wage for a us citizen to do the job illegal immigration has made driven down the cost of labor to pathetic levels
