pride month stems from the stonewall riots in ny in the 70s a protest started by black trans women to protest police brutality toward queer people as time has passed and queer rights have progressed it has evolved from a protest into a celebration of our freedom and equality i am proud to be queer bc even though i was born this way existing while queer is an act of courage things have come a long way since stonewall but theres still a ways to go so we celebrate that we can be out and proud and we protest bc there is still inequality and violence toward queer people
