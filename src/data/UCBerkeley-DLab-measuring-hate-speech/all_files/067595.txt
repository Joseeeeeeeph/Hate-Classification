people have sex for pleasure and physical connection with another person its always been like that just cause you dont like it that dont mean it should be enforced on everyone else thats such a stupid thing to say preaching only have sex for kids is not going to do shit you implied kids are a consequence for having sex what is that other then a punishment it would probably cause more people to end below the poverty line are you telling me you never had sex until you were financially secure
