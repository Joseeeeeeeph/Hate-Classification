why was some parts of the bible written because my early iron age nomadic sheepfucking ancestors didnt have the internet and porn to keep them entertained so they had to find something else to do and they were probably dehydrated out in the desert and may have been hallucinating so they mixed in an unhealthy dose of old myths and total garbage and bad morals shook well cooked and served a better question would be why anyone in the modern age still believes this shit
