well ill be 31 in a few weeks back when i started college 2006 i didnt know i was trans because i just thought of trans people as the people who do drag shows all i knew was that i felt comfortable going through life as male and that i hated being grouped with women or masculine lesbians that wasnt me i realized i was trans in my 20s though but it was before it got all the publicity that it does now
