it isnt that people shouldnt come out especially if thats what they want life can be very hard if i was out 10yrs ago i know there are several field jobs i would have missed or could have been beat up drugged up red necks are not the most stable group if you have a support system of friends and co workers who will be there for you then it will be easier to all those who have come out the rest of us are grateful we wish we could do the same we love our queer side we also love our kids and having a safe place to sleep at night
