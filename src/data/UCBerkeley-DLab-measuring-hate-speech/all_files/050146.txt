yes when i had my oh shit im gay moment i was raised a typical good christian girl believing id get married and have three kids and a dog until i met her she was friends with my best friend she turned my world around i fell hard for her too hard i realised i was gay when i couldnt stop thinking about her and imagining what itd be like to hold her hand it didnt ruin my life but it certainly made the next three years of my life pretty hard with coming out to family and coming to terms with it im happy now though
