my point is that this isnt a new kind of debate this is the other side of integration it happened when universities integrated racially and historically black collegesfraternities debated how to include white people and just like how those collegesfraternities found they could ultimately advance their aims while including white people womens sports can likely find a way to given women the benefit of athletics without having to exclude trans women or honestly men you could imagine a historically womens league for example
