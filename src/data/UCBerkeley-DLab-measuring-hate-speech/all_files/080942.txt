donald trump is playing a very dangerous game with this country so dividedwith his ability to say what the average white person is saying behind closed doorsthis type of language brings ignorance and hatred to non whites and its growing stronger by the day and unless this man is stopped im afraid violence towards one another will be so bad that the united states will pray for forgiveness for letting him destroy the values that we truly stand for
