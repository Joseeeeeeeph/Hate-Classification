its not a womens issue its just that there is a stigma about men having it personally im in and out of it not severely but enough to have my good days and bad days basically when i speak to my friends and family regardless of gender i ask how they are doing im happy to open up about my troubles and while some have opened up i recognise that others just dont want that yet and thats ok
