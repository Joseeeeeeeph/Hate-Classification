good and deep response especially the end of it i like how you see it now you should definitely do what will you make happy doesnt matter what other people say and if you can find peace with yourself without medical intervations then it is probably the best solution btw in my case my gender issues started when i was around 12 and very slowly progressed to the point if no return but it wasnt caused by evaluation of societal advantages rather with sexual identity feelings i was crossdressing and secretly wished i was female for 18 years
