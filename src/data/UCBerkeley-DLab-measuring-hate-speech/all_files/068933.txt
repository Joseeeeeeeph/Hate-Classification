i completely understand this i like both women and men but i never dated a woman and ended up married to a wonderful man i dont know to the extent i like women would i have dated one if i hadnt met my husband at 21 etc but it was a very confusing time for me thankfully my husband has been understanding and encouraging me that its okay to be who i am and honestly we check out women together like goofballs i guess all that rambling to say im here if you want to talk about any of this and ill be completely understanding feel free to reach out anytime
