do you base tennis performance on huge and size rather skill and athleticism well serena was quite small when she won her first grand slam and she beats all those bigger white players you could invite all those huge white women to join the game if you think its that simple please dont be biased shes has everything the game demands and at 37 years she cant run around much shes been able to balance it mentally just like roger federer pray for god to bless you with such gift in your endeavours dont envy
