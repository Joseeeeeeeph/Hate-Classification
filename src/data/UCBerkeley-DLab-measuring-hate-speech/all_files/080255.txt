i have no gripes but i grew up envious of the looks of my full filipino half brother i just think asian guys look cool so i would be happy if i was full asian however i dont like the idea of being or looking like someone other than myself so im content im pretty asian passing as well so thats adds to it culturally im basically just asian so being a hapa is a negative in that light since i never get treated as such by anyone outside my asian friends
