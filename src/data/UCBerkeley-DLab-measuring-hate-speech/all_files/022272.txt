well i always kind of viewed pride month black history month etc as somewhat self alienating im not antagonizing anyone i know for sure that people will get offended i dont have to support these months to support equality among everyone in terms of gender race orientation etc i dont view them as any different from everyone but to me these events are just telling me that theyre a different set of people i am a minority here myself but i would feel very uncomfortable if people celebrated and dedicated a month telling me how different i am
