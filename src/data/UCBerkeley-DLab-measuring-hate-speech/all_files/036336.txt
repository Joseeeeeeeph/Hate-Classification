heres a fun story i just graduated high school and for reference im a straight guy one of the best parts about high school dances was being able to pick on hyper masculine dudes i went to most of the dances without a date and even the time i did go with a date she understood the joke and would let me go off and make the aforementioned hyper masculine guy uncomfortable by trying to slow dance with him
