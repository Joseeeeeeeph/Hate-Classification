nothing but accusations with absolutely no proof to show the allegations i find it to be ironic that a female news reporter reporting the story coming from another news reporter and not a male reporting the story its funny because they may have put her on the air to further gain the sympathy of its viewers for the female reporter with no evidence you know being a news reporter and all you would think it would be on tape but its not also the fact that he went on air to prove himself is enough said nice agenda
