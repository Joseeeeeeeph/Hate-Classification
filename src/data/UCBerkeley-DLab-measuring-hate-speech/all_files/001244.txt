i know this is neither relevant to running or transition but reading your post just gave me insight to myself ive got a medical disorder that causes me to have high testosterone for a woman ive had it all my life the funny thing is that i present as very femme but i cant make female friends because like you noted socially women used to be a nightmare to try to socialize with lol yea my whole life i thought i was just weird the only great female friends i had were in transition now i just realized it was my hormoneswelp fuck me right thanks for the insight
