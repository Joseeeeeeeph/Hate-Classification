i think its very important for lgbt people who have grown up in homophobic environments especially young people to see a bunch of people like them being joyous and visible for a month just to show them that the future can be a happy place for them too imagine being made to feel lesser and ashamed your whole life and then seeing a whole parade dedicated to celebrating and defending people like you it can be a literal life saver
