my life has improved dramatically since i first came out when i was 15 being able to take control of my life and transition both socially and physically has been amazing what most people dont know is that when you are trans you dont just come out once theres coming out to your family your friends at school at work it never actually ends every new person you meet is someone that you might come out to you also have to decide if you want to come out to someone you dont have to it might be unsafe to it might work out wonderfully and youll gain a new ally
