funny thing was i did question it when i was in my early teens and though i might be bi or curious but i was most definitely into girlswomen turns out the world around me was just a lot more homophobic than i was and i thought that if you werent *repulsed* by the idea of a naked man then you might be gayish took about a year and no experiments thank god that would have been a disater to work out that im straight so thankful that my parents gave me the support and freedom to work that out on my own
