the part that finally got to me was this while you dont dislike your current gender you still experience euphoria from dressing likebeing called a different gender thats basically exactly how i feel right now i am fine being male having a penis and everything but i hate having body hair yet at the same time when i imagine being treated like a girl or dressing up like one i have that tingly feeling that sense that while im satisfied now id be happier like that thank you for posting this
