hes saying that the tenets of religion that focus on treating others with kindness and not taking advantage of others are a good basis i saw it stated recently that the differences between catholicism and protestantism are a big cause for concern at least in the us catholics teach that not only your belief in god is necessary but also your actions on earth to get into heaven so they also focus on kindness toward others for protestants only the belief and acceptance of god is necessary so taking advantage of others isnt frowned upon
