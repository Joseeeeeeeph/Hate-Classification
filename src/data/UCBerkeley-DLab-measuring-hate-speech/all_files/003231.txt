i completely understand your view point its 100 okay to celebrate bi women loving women and people have preferences for women which is also perfectly okay but its just all this focus on women and how beautiful and perfect they are and other stuff honestly leaves many guys not feeling good enough and even icky in comparison i know you bi women have to face a lot of shit im not having a go at any of you its just as a bi dude i sorta want my little view point on the situation understanding no hard feelings
