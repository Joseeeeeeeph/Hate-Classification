i take ballet classes among others in uni id hardly consider myself a dancer though as ive barely been studying dance for two years its actually really difficult for me especially in modern dance class we have to do a whole lot of really touchy exercises and i just feel so guilty like these girls would be so uncomfortable if they knew i was gay i feel like im violating their trust bcos internalized homophobia much luck to you in your ballet career i am so full of admiration dancers are so beautiful and graceful regardless of sexuality
