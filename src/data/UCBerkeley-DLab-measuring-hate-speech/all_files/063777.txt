mainly that when i tell people oh im not really attracted to any one gender just kinda people my copy paste response to questions about my attraction it doesnt mean that im sexually attracted to everyone and would just lay down and let anyone have a go at my genitals as much as i love when non lgbt people have genuine curiosity in my lgbt stuff i really dislike it when they assume i want to have sex with them just because im not bothered by gender
