i just used lebanon as an example because its relatively stable right now as far as middle eastern countries go officially lebanon is a christian country anyhow a lot could change in lebanon especially if there is a war with iran or the situation gets more tense with israel but granted a lot can change anywhere the bottom line is armenia needs the diaspora just as much as the diaspora needs armenia if not more thats the point that i was making without the diaspora armenia as a country would be like moldova
