im a white boy but my husband is puerto rican i embrace all kinds of culture and really appreciate what his familys culture is all about i try to embrace it i went to pr with his family this past spring and im left realizing that i really ought to better learn spanish the funny thing is i often forget that dating outside your race is supposed to be taboo every so often i realize we hit with a double whammy of sorts of two stupid rules that are meant to be followed
