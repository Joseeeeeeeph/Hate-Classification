im going to pitch in with something i havent seen anyone else say i agree with how you view privilege and all that im not sure if you are white or not but im assuming you arent its not that youre wrong about privilege its just really really hard for people who have had a hard life to be told it could be worse and that theyre lucky theyre white no one who is at rock bottom or who has been there before likes to have their experiences trivialized thats why a lot of talk about white privilege falls on deaf white ears
