disappointed human no it doesnt i myself am a pakistani and i know for a fact that pakistanis dont forget the person who has helped them we consider it a debt that we have to pay at any cost like we have to help them in any way possible just like how they helped us i can bet my life on it that those parents would have thanked every single doctor so much that theyd be embarrassed it was incredible what those doctors did and no one can take that away from them learn to respect everyone even if you dont agree with them
