the lack of situational awareness or threat assessment i play against younger highschool kids sometimes and it drives me up a wall when the ur dragon player kills a do nothing merfolk player rather than my well known combo deck thats about to pop off because the merfolk player countered him like seriously dude i play to win but that doesnt even feel like a win
