asian american living in japan for a few years now i like that i blend in no weird stares or people expecting me to be their free english tutor it does suck that people assume youre a native speaker but it motivated me study the language harder also even though i changed up my style its easy to distinguish different types of asians by their fashion and makeup i would say 50% of people that i meet can still tell im american before my accent gives me away
