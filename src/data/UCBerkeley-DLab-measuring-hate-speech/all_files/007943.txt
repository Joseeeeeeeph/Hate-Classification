the druze are one of the most fascinating people in israel i have met some in the army and from neighboring villages they have good food some of their high schools rank highest in matriculation rates and all in all they helped jews since 1948 or even before what i love the most about them is the strong sense of solidarity which reminds me that of jewish communities
