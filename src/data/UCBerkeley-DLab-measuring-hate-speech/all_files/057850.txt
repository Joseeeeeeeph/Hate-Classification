ive tried crossdressing occasionally when ive had the chance in secret and it felt really amazing except for when i look in the mirror just seeing my face makes me feel like i have no idea what im doing i just wish there was some way i could split into two separate people a straight man and a transgender woman in order to see which one makes me feel more comfortable and happy because i honestly cant tell i will make sure not to rush into anything though and go at my own steady pace your story of your friend sounds like my worst fear come true oo
