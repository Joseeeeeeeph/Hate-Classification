i think any guy whether they are average or below average looking can get a girl to fall in love with them or even just hookup with them i see it all the time beautiful women dating men who are unattractive i use to think these women were maybe after money i think with some people looks just doesnt matter to them take for instance jay z and beyonce everyone thinks she too pretty to be with him he actually dated a lot of beautiful women even though people find him unattractive
