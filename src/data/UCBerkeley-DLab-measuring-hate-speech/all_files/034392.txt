among people my age lgbt is pretty much just a meme there are lots of gaylesbianbi people who are totally normal and they are always accepted even by the religious kids but the ones who obnoxiously fit all the lgbt stereotypes are literally considered a fucking joke personally i have no problem with anybody like that until their actions start to affect my life
