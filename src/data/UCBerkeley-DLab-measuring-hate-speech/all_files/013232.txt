can relate i left islam when i was 16 a year and a half later i discover that i have at least 3 ex muslim now atheist cousins who are all older than me which is even better to be fair i always the oldest one of them was an atheist but i never asked fearing he might not be until we opened up about religion which was one of the best moments in my life
