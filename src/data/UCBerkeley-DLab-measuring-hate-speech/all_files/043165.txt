literally no one is saying you cant take pride in your personal identity but when its only brought up as a response to other celebrating theirs it just paints a victim complex cause i only hear about people insisting how important straight pride is during pride month or white pride during black history month use your personal pride as a positive thing not as a way to tear down another persons and people will more often than not respect it
