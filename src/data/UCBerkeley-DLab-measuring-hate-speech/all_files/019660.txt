thank you i do see a lot of arguments directed towards us aces that are very similar to arguments i saw about bi people 10 to 20 years ago for a long time i even thought i was bi because my attraction to all genders is basically the samejust that its little to none its all so sad to me a community based on being accepted as they are yet so many are unaccepting of others unless our struggles are exactly the same as theirs
