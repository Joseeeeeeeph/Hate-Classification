our struggle is kinda the opposite im androgynous but leaning to the masculine side because i dont know how to get in touch with my feminine side and ive never given myself a chance to get in touch with it because of boys i kinda get how you feel in a way its so hard to be feminine knowing that boys will line up right in front of you and even if i tell them that im a lesbian most will shrug it off and will continue to their advances
