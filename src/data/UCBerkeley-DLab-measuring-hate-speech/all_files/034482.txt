ive cried every time ive watched this video im not sure if its because of how much this resonates with me as a lesbian or if its joy at your courage in creating this art for the rest of us you didnt have to do this you didnt have to make these deeply personal intimate raw vignettes public but im sincerely glad you did i truly wish this was around back when i was questioning it may have cleared so much up i hope another young queer person finds this and in turn finds themself i hope you find light in your life eugene
