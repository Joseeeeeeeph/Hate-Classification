over here in the us they passed on harriet tubman most likely due to never having chose a woman and a black woman at that but the uk is considering putting a gay man on the 50 pound note well as the church lady from saturday night live would say isnt that special one expected move for women and women of color but one giant step for someone from the lgbtq community figures let them not celebrate woman or people of a different race but let them make damn sure to celebrate being from an immoral lifestyle woo hoo
