first of all youre already a woman if you want to be second i fully appreciate and relate to this feeling i wish i could just be a cis woman but i cant ive been fortunate in that my transition has been smooth and hassle free so far the court fucked up and it delayed my name change but that wasnt just me that was the whole citys court filing system i hope things can smooth out and progress can become easier for you so you can share the woman you are with the world
