i get the point that you can still talk about how hot you find someone without it immediately being a gender thing but in this case calling it sad that shes not a male fantasy has a similar tack to incels feeling entitled to sex and feeling womens purpose is to look attractive incel might be a buzz word or whatever but its just a useful word the comparison is still justified
