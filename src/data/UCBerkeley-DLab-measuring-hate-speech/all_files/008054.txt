agreed there is no american feminism or middle east feminism theres a white feminism term that refers to feminists that only care about problems of wealthy white women manspreading mansplaining etc and theres actual feminism that cares about the important stuff like struggles of women in middle east you dont have to be american to be a white feminist you can be american and still be an actual feminist
