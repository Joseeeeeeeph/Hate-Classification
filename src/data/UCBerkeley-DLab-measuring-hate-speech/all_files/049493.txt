terrible and they should be fired i read about the first 25 posts or so i counted 5 racist ones 3 were super obvious 2 were borderline there was one with 3 white people where the cops seemed to be just as hateful towards seems like theyre just frustrated underpaid power trip assholes doesnt make it ok but i bet they wish the backlash against some of these idiots like the young kid who took a bat into a store and randomly knocked someone out for fun would be 14 as harsh as they were on cops
