id say thats better than the alternative though im all for someone changing their stance on lgbtq rights in general because it finally hits close to home and they can actually see the effects on someone they care about instead of some faceless other they dont care about its much better than when it does hit close to home and they instead decide to try conversion therapy or disowning their kids
