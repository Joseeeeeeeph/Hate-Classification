its actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women we train to be funny whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive if you arent funny we arent going to laugh ive heard great female comedians but its not hard to see why there are more male comedians girls dont need to be funny to have sex
