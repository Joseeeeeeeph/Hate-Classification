okay so now the fuck your feelings crowd is super interested in the feelings of young men when it can be used to dictate the behavior of women funny coincidence there one of the ideological subs is populated with people who upvote calls for violence the other is populated with people who downvote calls for violence which one is hateful probably the one that gets people to go out and shoot up churches speaking of how fucked is it that the one guy admitted he was radicalized by ben shapiro i havent heard you guys say shit about that
