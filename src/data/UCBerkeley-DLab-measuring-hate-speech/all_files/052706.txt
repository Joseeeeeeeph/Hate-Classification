dating wise i actually think being a lesbian is beneficial in some ways if i were dating guys id constantly be worried they were fetishizing me for my race with girls i dont worry about that at all biggest problems in general are probably family dynamics even tho my family is fairly progressive i dont plan on coming out anytime soon
