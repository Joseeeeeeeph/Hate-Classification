dudes need to grow up and get over themselves maybe its because im trans or a decent human being but i was livid when my partner told me her exs made her hide them in a drawer rather have them within reach of the toilet ill never have a period but that doesnt change the fact that half the human population deals with it its bad enough as is without all the cultural shame and stigma
