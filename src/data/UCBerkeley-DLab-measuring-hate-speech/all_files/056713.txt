i feel really sorry for people with severe disabilities and their families imagine youre getting old and about to die and your adult child still cant look after themselves they know they are leaving their kids to the shittiest lives imaginable just like the pro life people dont care about any children after their born none of them are rushing off to adopt adults with no chance of independence put your money where your mouth is go and adopt a 50 year old with severe down syndrome if that was me fucking kill me please i would rather not be born
