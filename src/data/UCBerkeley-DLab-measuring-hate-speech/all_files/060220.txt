theres honestly alot of asians that we dont know of that are like that in large population areas such as la or ny it really depends on how were raised is what i believe im guessing asian parents pound their culture into their kids more than other ethnicities do idk just my opiniontheory on it but i like to have the pros of both from the culture and american mainstream dont want to lose where im from either im proud of it and living in america means i learn new things too that can put me at an advantage in some way too
