in all respect for your denomination and catholics why does it really matter it matters because we pass on our faith to our children and get our marriages blessed in the church i guess i would think if your part of the body of christ it really shouldnt matter where you get married or attend as long as its supporting growth and keeping you focused on jesus we disagree on what the church is the protestant belief is an invisible church of all believers apostolic churches believe in a visible church i wont debate that as it wont be fruitful i am answering your question
