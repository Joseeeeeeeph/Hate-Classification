not to derail but im pretty sure the planet could easily sustain 7 billion if 10 of the population wasnt ruining 90 of the planet i do think mormons should have less kids though because its a lot of rich spoiled religious people who are ruining the planet because the second coming will fix it all so they dont need to care or let it get in the way of their moneymaking or some bullshit
