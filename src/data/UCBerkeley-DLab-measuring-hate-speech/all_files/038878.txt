because alot of them view catholicism as some sort of paganism that catholics worship mary and the saints and holding the pope in some sort of god like status they also dont believe in the need to go to a priest for just about anything they dont see the need for what they seem as a mediator between jesus and the faithful it is based out of ignorance about the catholic faith and what the church actually teaches regarding these concepts
