i just love having boobs and being ultra feminine tbh i always had a very feminine body type and developed very late compared to most guys i decided that becoming transsexual is honestly the best route for me and where i would fit in the most now i live all the time as a woman and im completely passable never really had any dysphoria or had the typically story of playing with girl toys
