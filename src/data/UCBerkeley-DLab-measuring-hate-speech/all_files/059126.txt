having a label makes others more comfortable with themselves especially if they need to switch pronouns as someone who identifies as a woman it affects me because of the way the country i live in us where things are getting pretty scary for women so for me it matters potentially having my rights taken away and watching my friends rights already get taken away has been an awful scary experience so its important for me as a woman to stand up for other women and be supportive when things get tough and scary its about unity for me
