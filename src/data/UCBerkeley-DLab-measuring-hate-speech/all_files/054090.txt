my two closest friends i knew theyd be accepting and one of them was openly bi as well im still not out to anyone else yet i know theyll be accepting but i just havent felt the need to tell them and funny story it turns out the other friend is bi or at least somewhere towards the middle of the kinsey scale so i guess lgbt magnetism is a real thing
