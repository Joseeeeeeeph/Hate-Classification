i disagree i am gay i recognize that he was sprinkling in some cute little gay jokes in with his commentary my straight friends are like this with me i think it actually reveals a level of comfort with homosexuality rather than homophobia homophobia is more like an aversion or nervousness to even talking about homosexuality to joke about it in the conservative movement i think is wonderful because its so subjective your opinion varies from mine the policy should reflect that no one is infallible and we should just be able to speak our minds freely
