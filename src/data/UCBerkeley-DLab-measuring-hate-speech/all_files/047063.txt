how would an atheist worship the idea that god is bad if heshe lacks a belief in said gods that to me makes the statement nonsense you cant feel something is good or bad if you dont think it exists as far as feeling a sense of community and a place refuge you dont need religion to do thatyou need community realworldcommunity how someone can seek solice in make believe friends and gather together with folks who also allow themselves to make believe as well and think thats perfectly fine is beyond me
