sorry about the archive it gets across the paywall anyway this is really long and i hesitate to try to wrap it up in a single top level comment but i will say that she definitely got a very good cross section of white american men to talk about how they feel about this its worth reading all the way through and its very specifically the intersection of white and male so i imagine it talks in broad strokes about the guys who post here
