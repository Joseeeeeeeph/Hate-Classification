i have really been thinking about just coming out to her because then she knows i am a lesbian and that kind of puts the ball in her court if that makes sense i mean honestly there is no reason why i wouldnt come out to her she is one of the most progressive and supportive open minded people i know its just no matter what coming out is a super scary thing
