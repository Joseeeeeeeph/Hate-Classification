never understood why someone feels the need to proud of their race at all you did nothing to earn it you cant change it it doesnt shouldnt matter to anyone and if it does thats their problem not yours if a person wants to look back through history and take pride in their ancestors accomplishments well ok but thats not a personal achievement you could as well claim to be proud of your gender or your height and that would all seem pretty meaningless if we define ourselves by our color then others will too not a good thing in general if history is any lesson
