this is the case for many people who dont have that childlike faith but on the contrary i have seen many many people convert to christianity or buddhism later in life because they feel like it will help them they enjoy the fellowship or simply because theyve had an encounter with god those two practices are common because they are easy to get involved with islam or hinduism or mormonism for example are much more difficult to just waltz into without being raised in a family that is part of that sect in the first place i know many many people who only converted as adults
