thats awesome how everyone is treating the crush my mum figured out my first crush when i was six and went nuts at me it wasnt because it was on a guy since im a girl it was because he wasnt white turns out i have a thing for asian guys but because my mum is racist as hell she got me terrified of mentioning guys to anyone and eventually the entire town including her decided i was a lesbian i was kicked out of the house for it me having posters and pictures of men up around my room didnt key her into the fact that i liked guys
