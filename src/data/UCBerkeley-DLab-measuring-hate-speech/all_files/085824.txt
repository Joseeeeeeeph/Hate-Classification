i dont know if its normal for toddlers but i react similarly to usually mosquito bites some people just have super adverse reactions discomfort aside the bites are not overly harmful but keep and eye on them i once had a bite become infected presumably from the scratching use a marker to draw a ring around the original bite and contact your dr immediately if it expands andor you get a white ring around the bite
