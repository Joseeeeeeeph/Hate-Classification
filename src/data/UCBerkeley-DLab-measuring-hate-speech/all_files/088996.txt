am cis not trans but just wanted to offer some hope to you a friend of mine came out to her wife a couple of years ago at the time apart from the kids part the wife had the same view it was touch and go for a while she really felt it was a dealbreaker after some therapy and much soul searching she realised she fell in love with the same person and she didnt want to be with anyone else they are still together happy and making it work
